						<div class="nanotitle">Scents of Nightshade</div>
						<div class="nanodescription"><p>Scents of Nightshade is embarrassingly autobiographical. Of course, several liberties were taken with regard to the "truth" to the extent where, after showing this novel to my Sifu who I *spoilers* end up killing in the last few pages, he looked me in the eye, head slightly tilted, brow slightly furrowed, and said very patiently, "I read this, and then I realized that this is all fiction, right?"</p>

							<p>Summary: You'll never know a man's psychological limits until you've crossed them. (Alternately) Robert, local hapless boob, is frustrated by life's tribulations. Eventually, he kills a guy</p>

	Krista was yelling through a really big bullhorn at her three comrades in the early morning dusk. It had been decided the night before that in honor of their fabulous record, the amazing four had to prepare an adequate welcoming for Robert. They had gathered at school two hours earlier than usual so they could prepare their special surprise for their new friend. This would be their greatest triumph yet, after all, who could resist such a warm welcome? Especially when that warm welcome included a complimentary continental breakfast (enough thought was put into it that they had decided that it was too early for gourmet cake and ice cream)? Subconsciously they had taken a page from their book: "#14, prepare a continental breakfast, after all, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach!" A great deal of frenzied cutting and pasting followed by the hanging of innumerable, hand-made decorations, all centered around the theme of Robert, befuddled the early morning Mexican janitors.</p>
<p>	"What are you... doing?"</p>
<p>	"Vamos a tener que limpiar eso para arriba?"</p>
<p>	The janitors sat, impassive as the bustling girls placed party hats and glitter traps around the central courtyard. Meredith recognized their fears and quickly placated them.</p>
<p>	"No, lo haremos."</p>
<p>	"Oh, gracias."</p>
<p>	The left the courtyard with their various cleaning implements to head down the Starbucks for a hit of espresso, and possibly a pastry. The girls clipped various colorful strips of paper and hung balloons and other adorable things. Soon, corny music from the 50's boomed forth from various speakers (they had assumed that it would fit any occasion) and plates were set out for the entire school. Confetti balls had been hung around the courtyard in strategic positions so that any stray flecks of paper would not harm each of the delicately grown plants in the yard.</p>
<p>	"Alright then, is everything ready?"</p>
<p>	"This shall be Ohsofantabulous!"</p>
<p>	"Let's get this party started!"</p>
<p>	"Why didn't we make a cake, again?"</p>
<p>	All four girls clapped excitedly as their plans came to fruition. Breaking for a delicate sip of tea, they never quite planned for anyone other than Robert to appear first.</p>

<div class="centertext">* * *</div>

<p>	Mr. Chu arrived a little earlier than usual that day. It was that time of the month again, lab season, which meant that he really needed to clean up the scorch marks on the ceiling lest something flammable ignite whatever crusty, flammable there was caked there. Clad in his whitewashing gear, he entered the ivy-encrusted gates of the school and made his way down a long flight of stairs.</p>
<p>	Something was a little bit off today. Was it the weather? Mr. Chu stuck out an inquiring hand, a gentle breeze ruffled the thin hairs on the back of his mitt; nothing was out of place there. He looked up at the overcast sky, that seemed to be normal too, Bay Area autumns were particularly dour, and not a cloud seemed out of place. What was it?</p>
<p>	Oh.</p>
<p>	The horrendous rainbow of cheerful colorings told him everything he needed to know. The amazing four were at it again. They were a local legend, performing their amazing feats of niceness and all, but few from beyond the confines of the Good Samaritan society were ever able to witness their inhuman, saintly deeds, let alone know anything about each of them personally. Many have claimed to see them in various UFO's or vampire goth clubs, but nobody really listened to them, all the evidence they produced amounted to little more than a pretzel salt (they were surprisingly tidy). The fact that so little was known about them troubled Mr. Chu, yet it excited him as well. Would he be one of the lucky few that caught the amazing four in action?</p>
<p>	Pace quickening, he descended into the courtyard with surprising alacrity for such a portly man, excitement tagging at his heels.</p>
<p>	"Hluagh! What's this!?"</p>
<p>	He burst straight through a large poster sporting Robert's features on the front, the fragile paper bowled over under his great weight.</p>
<p>	"Surprise!"</p>
<p>	The amazing four popped forward like springs and lovingly smothered Mr. Chu.</p>
<p>	"Hey... You're not Robert!" said Krista, hastily, she removed herself from the teacher, and ordered the rest of her friends to detach themselves from him.</p>
<p>	"Oh, hello Mr. Chu! How nice to see you!"</p>
<p>	Eilie quickly brushed Mr. Chu's suit back into order while Meredith and Sara helped him settle down with a bit of tea.</p>
<p>	"Hello? Meredith? Krista? Sara? Eilie? Mommy?"</p>
<p>	Still a bit disoriented, Mr. Chu succeeded in splashing a bit of the hot liquid into his face and making a general mess of things.</p>
<p>	"Oh no! Here, let me get that."</p>
<p>	Sara patted down the little brown droplets and all stared at him expectantly. His befuddlement demanding an explanation, Mr. Chu turned back around after being cleaned up and looked oddly at the various decorations and posters.</p>
<p>	"You're the amazing four, aren't you? What are you doing this for? Why do you have all this stuff up for this kid?"</p>
<p>	Eilie turned around totally understood his lack of comprehension, "Oh, well, it's be a good friend month and as Good Samaritans we're going to be extra fantabulous friends with Robert! He is OUR special buddy for the month!"</p>
<p>	The amazing four assumed one of their patented poses and batted their lashes at Mr. Chu. A look of puzzlement compounded his expression of bewilderment, but Mr. Chu let it go and replied with a non-confrontational response.</p>
<p>	"Oh, that's nice..."</p>
<p>	His gaze wandered a bit onto the various school-picture posters of whoever Robert was, and suddenly he remembered.</p>
<p>	"Say, isn't he that lonely kid that talks to that wall near the computer lab? I see him every day, playing games with and talking to that wall. I think he named it Mr. Wall, or something..."</p>
<p>	A look of abject horror followed by a startled gasp escaped from the eight pairs of lips of the amazing four. Meredith caught a collapsing Krista as Eilie and Sara placed two fists cutely at their lips. Naturally, they reacted in the most adorable, most innocent fashion possible.</p>
<p>	"Oh that poor child! He needs more good friendship than we thought!"</p>
<p>	Sara nearly burst into tears at the evident horror of the situation, and a great wave of sympathy was sent out to poor, unfortunate Robert. Krista was the first to recover.</p>
<p>	"Girls! You know what we have to do! We shall have to put extra effort into this project! He shall be our greatest feat of niceness EVER!"</p>
<p>	Uniting under the strength of their happiness, the four girls recomposed themselves and squealed once again in delight. They joined their hands in a pinwheel formation and returned to planning the party-esque celebration.</p>
<p>	There was something deeply troubling about this situation, but Mr. Chu could not quite place his hammy little finger on it. Hastily he retreated from the overly excited girls and brooded within his lab room while severely neglecting all stains on the ceiling. </p>
<br>
<div class="centertext">Robert Speaks:</div>

<p>	I had entered school from the back entrance since there seemed to be a big hullabaloo going about in the main courtyard. The last thing I wanted to do was be caught by a bunch of drunken seniors/hobos carousing long after curfew. I heard they could be dangerous in their alcohol-induced stupor. My mother had told me that they had a tendency to be very violent in their fun making, and it was no place for a respectable person like me to be. But in the end, what did she know about being hurtful? Had it not been she who had hurt me the most, recently? Sourly I wondered if I could ever decide what I wanted, if I could get drunk and not care and carouse in the early morning with my friends. </p>
<p>A sobering thought at best, bordering on depressive. </p>
<p>A chill wind tugged at the cotton jacket on my back. </p>
<p>It would have been nice to be popular, or even remotely socially active, but it was not something I really worked actively for. Not that I really cared about this stuff or anything... Really I didn't!</p>

<p><i>A gentle hand, so close, passing over mine, grazing the soft hairs on the back of my palm, a voice, so close, yet forever out of my reach
A gesture, so sincere, so calculated, a step down the long road, a destination forever chasing the horizon
A scent, so distinct, rapturous, never close enough, untouchable.</i></p>
	
<p>	I sighed, disheartened. Something was distinctly missing, something horribly important. Who was I kidding? My best friend was a wall, an immobile, cold, wall. Romance? Friendship? Other humans? Not even close.</p>
<p>	"Pish tosh, stop being so unhappy, Robert, you have a great family, moderately good grades, and a good head atop your shoulders! Smile!"</p>
<p>	And smile I did.</p>

<div class="centertext">* * *</div>

<p>	Mr. Chu waited, like he always did when he needed such favors. The dank, acrid odor of the dumpster made him cringe and shiver in distaste. It was still early in the morning; so the sun had not hit the pile of refuse yet, he was thankful for that. A strange umbra was cast over the midmorning sun, as the wispy lights seemed to shiver and fade into darkness. Unnatural shadows and red sparks like flint lights danced across the corners of Mr. Chu's eyes. Ah, they were here.</p>
<p>	"What do you want?"</p>
<p>	That strange, raspy voice, he could never get used to it, like chips of ice shattering against fragile class. A cold shiver ran up his spine as a black cloaked figure descended onto the dumpster next to him, never quite touching the ground. A wispy breath of vapor exuded forth from deep within the figure's cowl as it seemingly levitated to the ground. Catching his breath and forcing control back onto the situation, Mr. Chu stared into the depths of whatever eyes could be found on the figure.</p>
<p>	"I need you to keep an eye on a few people... I need you to watch the amazing four... And their new friend... Robert."</p>
<p>	Mr. Chu handed over a picture of each of the students, a hand, seemingly pale blue in tones, grasped it and it disappeared into one of its cloaks many folds. The figure nodded, as its companion seemingly melted forth from the shadows.</p>
<p>	"Will do."</p>
<p>	With a snap of their fingers, light returned to the earth in a blast of sunlight. Mr. Chu had to cover his eyes against the burst of color that had so suddenly returned to the earth. After slowly regaining balance, Mr. Chu checked for any sign of the two, and found that each of the two wraith-like beings had vanished.</p>

<div class="centertext">* * *</div>

<p>	"Hey guys, where's Robert?" asked Eilie, her growing concern evident as she shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>	"Oh, dear! I don't know... did any of you guys see him? Is he sick? Do you think he could have gotten hurt?!" panic rose in Sara's voice as she pondered the possibilities. The mere thought of Robert not being able to come shocked them thoroughly, how could they have managed to not take that into account?</p>
<p>	The amazing four did manage to pull of quite a feat though, they had managed to congregate the majority of the high school into the courtyard, however, and unfortunately, things had gone quite messily. All that remained of their continental breakfasts was a wasteland of Dixie utensils. The omelets had been reduced to cheesy little splotches, and the bacon no more than grease smears on paper plates. </p>
<p> Yet there had be no sightings of Robert, the man of the hour. In fact, few even understood what the celebration had been for. Now they lay, bellies bulging from whatever gorging they had just participated in, in pathetic heaps. The bell would ring soon, and the four had guessed that nobody would be on time that day.</p>
<p>	"No, I haven't seen him, I don't think anyone has."</p>
<p>	"Well, we should just check some of these people to see if one of them is him, I guess. Or maybe one of them knows where we could find him."
<p>	Just like Meredith and her common sense.</p>
<p>"It's a good thing that we made the breakfasts so big."</p>
<p>So the four picked through the various breakfast-bloated bodies that lay strewn about the courtyard in hopes of finding Robert, but all to no avail, he was nowhere to be found. A deep sense of despondency descended onto the four as disappointment sunk in.</p>

<p>"All our plans... and no Robert..."</p>
<p>The amazing four sank into a small pile, steeped in defeat. The urge to break down and cry almost overcame them, but Krista managed to find a shred of hope.</p>
<p>"Well, we shall just have to plan better next time, don't worry girls, we helped a lot of hungry high schoolers today! And we have done lots and lots of good! Be happy!"</p>
<p>	They took heart and weakly started cleaning up the courtyard. Next time they would be ready, and by golly they would be such incredible friends!</p></div>

<p>"Breakfast is ready" he called.
<p>"Didn't I say I wasn't particularly hungry?"
<p>"Yes, but why don't you have some anyway? It's good for you."
<p>Well, that was a blatant lie, if I had ever heard one, but I knew I would find no rest unless I gave in and shoveled a few bites into his mouth, or he did. I didn't want to think about the latter, father and his large, puppy dog eyes, gads, it was worse than actually kicking one of those small aforementioned mammals. It took a degree of caution, as well as a degree of caving in frequently to run this house, and I had found that I possessed enough of both. Nothing had changed, but then again, I had done my best to ensure that. But perhaps my patience was wearing thin this morning.
	<p>"I really don't want any, dad."
	<p>"You don't?"
	<p>I truthfully wasn't hungry. My stomach had been full of regret, pain and guilt, oh, the overwhelming guilt. There was no room in there for breakfast these days.
	<p>I had killed him, killed them as well, and broken many others. They were dead, gone, vanished, in the ground, silent; some, not all of those at the same time, but most in some combination of them. The dojo had closed, as it was now leaderless, its Sifu claimed by Nightshade poisoning. I read about it in the El Cerrito Journal the next day. Nobody had bothered to check the dank, dusty office until the next morning, and by then it was too late. They closed, and I was liberated for a time. But then realization set in, it was I, the innocuous one, that had did this, it was I that had ended Mr. Yoshida's life with some well-timed berry ingestion. I thought it was what I had wanted, but obviously I was not willing to pay the price, and would have gladly stopped myself, had I the opportunity. I was verily surprised that I had not been carted off to jail yet, what, with all the acts that tarnished my soul. I'd say it was visible, on my face, my hands, my lips, my eyes, my stride, any of those. If the world was so blind I had put too much faith in much of it. I hated myself for it, and knew that it would be something that would bother me at least for a very long time. Though, the Amazing Four were the ones I regretted hurting the most. Krista, Meredith, Sara and Eilie, they were gone. Yes, they were there, at school, physically, but they were never seen outside of class. What went on after school was also a mystery. Could my parents love me, still, if they knew what I had done? I wanted to cry, for the misdeeds, the death and everything else that I had consciously or unconsciously done, but I knew that I was not worthy enough for tears, how vapid and selfish they would be for me, the one who understood nothing, to shed.
	<p>"No, I don't, but thanks anyway."
	<p>"Okay..."
	<p>I left, departing for my bedroom, so I could prepare myself for school.

<div class="centertext">* * *</div>

<p>							They were drowning in blackness. The veil cast upon them had not left, ever since that night. Their world had no orientation and they fumbled their way around in the darkness, working about their daily lives as best they could. Ever since that night, in the Chemistry lab room, they had lost something irreplaceable. It was far more valuable than any chemical or substance that could ever be sold from that room, and they groped to once again acquire something that could perhaps aid them in their quest to once again have an identity.
<p>	Krista, Meredith, Sara and Eilie huddled close, clasping onto each other lest they fall away into oblivion. They had forgotten so much, their memories only remaining in fragments of emotion, moments of love, of joy, of sadness, the only chords that rung true in all of their minds were the events of that night. The shattering glass, the fire extinguisher, the theft, all replayed itself in both conscious living and unconscious dreams as if it had happened yesterday. She turned to her partners, and the kindness of warmth held them together in solidarity. Piece by piece, together they rebuilt their past, the veil of darkness fracturing, then fragmenting, falling away slowly as a kind hand removed the jagged bits from before their eyes. No longer would they have to shamble in the gloom, they could finally see, witness uninhibited once again as whole human beings.
	<p>But the world was not as they had left it.

<div class="centertext">* * *</div>

<p>	He spent most of his days with Mr. Wall, but no more were there words to share, or gestures to make. He sat in silence as thought drove him just a little bit madder with each passing moment. Not that Mr. Chu didn't already consider him quite out of his mind, from what he saw. What, with throwing glassware and killing people with poisonous berries. No, he wasn't, really. Mr. Chu should have known better, best not to jump to such conclusions.
	<p>Mr. Chu backed away from the window, Robert had never really figured out that people were watching him from up there, or at least they could vaguely make out what he was doing. From the dark silhouette he could make out a lonely boy, a tortured one now. Yes, he had done nothing once Robert had taken the berries, he didn't think he'd needed to. He... just... wouldn't ever have dreamt that Robert would kill someone. In cold blood, for whatever sick reason seemed to make sense to the boy at the time. He made the link immediately once he saw the story in the papers. That vicious little prat poisoned that dojo master person. And he got away with it too.
	<p>Why hadn't Mr. Chu turned him in?
	<p>He asked himself that same question repeatedly, each time he saw the boy. More than once he had picked up the phone, dialed in 911, was ready to sick the police on the boy, but each time he had stopped himself. Robert's fate... it would be in his hands, and jail was not a pretty place. Just give it a few more days' thought, please. They'll accept evidence late, even if it is simply word of mouth.
<p>	He moved towards his lunch, stirring its contents, perhaps it could provide some insight into the situation. The fried zucchini, however, proved to be no help once again, no matter how hard he tried to divine some sort of meaning from the floppy vegetable. And it was cold, which made things worse. It was no longer pressing, this conscience; it had been weeks, almost a month or two, even, since the incident. It was frightening, the way he had stopped really caring, how it all seemed so insignificant in the end. It wasn't really worth it. Not anymore. He looked once at Robert, who slumped, quivering against that brick wall of his and knew that he would be doing no more harm, he was punishing himself enough, wallowing in regret. Hunger, in the meantime, began to bother him. He decided that it was perhaps time to give it a good reheat (the proper way, without using lab equipment). He exited his lab and walked down hall towards the faculty workroom.
	<p>"Alan!" a voice jostled him out of his stumpy little walk. He turned to see who it was, and found fellow teacher Bernie Blanking following him down the hall.
	<p>"Yes? Do you need something?"
	<p>"So, I've heard that you were Carmen and Spencer's last client."
	<p>Bernie's voice was laced with threat, though it was not obvious. Mr. Chu was taken aback as he came to a full stop, spilling bits of vegetable and rice on the floor, jaw stiffening at the mention of those names. He hadn't heard from those two since that night, and had only assumed that they thought they had finished their duty.
	<p>"I was."
	<p>"Then, perhaps if I could have a word in private?"
	<p>"Certainly."
	<p>Mr. Chu was brusquely pulled into the single occupant faculty restroom. It was designated for females, but for all practical purposes, both genders were allowed to use it, at least until a female began complaining, or there was some incident involving a violation of privacy, somehow. Or odors, nobody liked odors.
	<p>"They've quit The Society, did you know that?"
	<p>"Why, no, I didn't."
	<p>"We have references saying that it was because of you that they decided to stop, just give it all up cold turkey, they didn't even give recommendations or anything. Now The Society is two agents short."
<p>	Mr. Chu could find no appropriate response to that. He wasn't sure whether it was a demand, a request, or simply a venting, but he did not fail to sense the tension in the man's features. The usually angelic lines scrunched up, and knotted tight at his brow.
<p>	"Tell me, what did you do to them? What did they do?"
<p>	Their exchange was cut short as the door to the bathroom swung upon, admitting a fairly disgruntled middle-aged woman that clutched at her pant-line.
	<p>"Out of the way! It's an emergency!"
	<p>When neither failed to move (they had simply begun to stare at her, motionless) she glared at each individually.
	<p>"D'you want to see this old crone use the restroom? Hmm? Not a pretty sight, I guarantee that much..."
<p>	And both parted rapidly, Mr. Chu peeling off and deserting Mr. Blanking outside the restroom. Once back in the safety of the chemistry lab, the cold food seemed to suffice.</p>
<br>
<div class="centertext">Robert Speaks:</div>

<p>	The sense of magic associated with school had faded long ago, and I knew I could not reclaim it. I knew it had left long before, but only now did I begin to miss it. Just once I considered that maybe it would be nice to have another wish, or maybe another Sunday Brunch provided for the whole school (even though I never did get to participate fully in that, I did seem to romanticize the idea, forever ingraining it in my head as something shiny to strive for). But no, school much like everything else felt like depression. No escape for the wicked. No respite, no escape, no joy for the wicked. It seemed that there seemed to be little distraction as well. I was with Mr. Wall again, but he could not help me here, I had alienated myself from him, and he was not going to come back. One after another my "friends" had left me. There had been few glimmers in life that I could look forward to, and now, as the number dwindled down to zero, I wondered if I had truly ever meant to be this stupid.

						<div class="nanochapter">	<p>She could not feel the tendrils of ivy as they twisted up her woolen dress. Viscerally, their sad emerald leaves were so soft, so alluring, they meant her no harm, though bodily she knew nothing; feeling had been the first sensation to go. She could neither feel the network of roots and nourishing earth beneath her legs nor the great distance between each thought.
	<p>It had been different with her grandfather, she remembered. She looked at him now, across the spacious grove in which they both sat. Though space and darkness caused her to barely be able to make out his shape, a shade of terror chilled her, if only for a moment. She told herself that she would never forget: he spoke of the blackness that surrounded him first, and then the infinite silence, and then he too lapsed into silence as he finally released her hand. She barely recognized him, so enclosed had his body become, his head tucked into his knees, a precious pearl that desired to be hidden from sight, his hair had frozen in place, permanently shorFt around his bald pate. His skin had become stone, so smooth and hard, as his own solitude crept over him, and over the years it appeared as if he caved in upon himself. Granite under the vision of night, converted from the pebbled white that appeared in the gloam of the evening. He had been strong, though it was becoming hard for her to remember; a whisper of the truth seemed to be spoken in the language of command: the same ivy that wound its way up her leg had stopped at his hips, content to not proceed further. In the stillness of the night air around them both, the five-points of each leaf vibrated, shuffling to welcome nothing. Then her terror, too, was gone.
	<p>She remained there for hours, perhaps, though there was no way for her to know, as the firmament turned about her like a whirling top, gathering and rotating like spirits in motion, inchoate, unbounded bodies against a velvety sky, the gibbous moon being the sole heavenly axis.
	<p>Her father had been different. One morning she woke up in her bed and he was no longer there. He lay down that day, from no illness other than an inexplicable, but doomed tiredness; and there he lay, flexed now and only partly visible beneath a blanket of verdant green. But she had already said her goodbye. His heart had gone years before the rest of him, after those loveless days, weeks, months, it seemed as if life had left him long ago. 
	<p>The sounds of the forest and the creeping, pale animals around her emptied forth from her mind, that part of it now alabaster and granite and impenetrable. 
<p>She knew, in a way, that was how it all began, with the heart. The heart kept her away from this place, the heart drew her forth from indifference, the heart allowed her to live. Only when it tired or sickened did the anesthesia of solitude take hold and bring her back to what the heart desperately fought against.
<p>They all lay about her, in the creeping dead of night, composing something that she knew she would help complete, each of their enclosed bodies burnished by the sun and the rain and the clinging, phantasmal ivy that would never be cut. She knew the figures of her mother, her aunt, and relatives that somehow had brushed through her life just barely enough to make an impression; they garnered no feeling, not a single stirring of soul. The small figures in a circle around her remained a vague mystery, their identities ready to be pondered over a cup of tea and needlework at some later date.
<p>The spicy scents of the forest no longer reached her as she realized that she could no longer taste the night air. The smells of rich earth and comforting bark that was good for tea would remain only in memory now, and soon, those too, were gone. She unbound her hair, discarding the tie in a place where no moonlight could shine while letting the lank, gray strands settle on her shoulders. Somehow it seemed like the appropriate thing to do, though she knew not why.
<p>The infinite emptiness of loss stood before her now, and her only reply could be the pale brown of her eyes, splintered gray-warm and not quite vibrant. As the ground composing the precipice gave way she could no longer feel fear.
<p>Fragmented images were all that were recalled now. Ivy-up-to-the-hips, summer-sweet cherries that fell off the tree, a mystery, the warmth of a hearth, a cottage, biting lips, stitched sleeves and a day at the market when there was no more grain.
<p>There was no distress. She only knew aching slowness, the present and the now mystifying stone carvings left outside too long in the rain.
<p>She tilted her head up, for her sight refused to leave her. She turned and watched the blushing dawn reaching above the treetops. Slowly the stars faded from view, consumed by the feathery rays of light that watered the sky. One, two, three. Each point of light received its due as the sun allowed one parting bow from each of them. One, two, the sky began to swim as her eyes began to betray her. One, one, one as shards of light took wing and disappeared over the crests of high growing trees that glowed flaming green against vanishing darkness. Count, count, count, for she no longer knew what numbers meant. Ah, ah, ah each thudding beat of a stone heart which shivered to push out one more breath of blood that ran as cold as a glacier. The final star flashed from across the sky behind her and blurred down, down, down as she allowed the final release.
<p>The ground shuddered and splintered on impact as the star blazed into the grove, flaming and glorious. Statue as well as ivy were both incinerated instantly in the area of impact. In a moment of confusion the spiraling entity rose and hovered in mid-air before unfurling itself into its full, twisting length. While coiled it seemed that the creature was not much larger than a human was, but, impossibly, as it extended itself a mass of writhing rope, each the thickness of a tree trunk, unbound a face that remained the height of a man. It possessed numerous wings of such brilliance that they left imprints between eye and eyelid, and as its fiery sheath burned away, its hues, metallic yet infinitely soft, were only intensified. 
<p>A thundering shock of color plunged her mind into chaos, she sensed a part of it do something that felt strangely like a shrug. Her eyes snapped open, but it seemed that she could only witness.
<p>Supple amber skin covered the head that hung above a swan-like neck that did not end, but rather continued into a tangle of wing and sundry appendage. The head rose as the neck elongated and the creature's limbs shot forth in all directions like javelins. It thrashed and crushed and stamped fury against stone figure, its sinuous hands, wings, claw, tail and feet each taking one body and dematerializing it into earthen particles, shattering ivy that refused to give way like glass. The plant riled and frothed back into the ground through an infinite amount of cracks, bubbling like a cauldron in reverse it discarded the remaining bodies it held in thrall. The creature let out a blast from its mouth that seemed like a roar, a force that could split and make barren the ears of every living thing that heard it.
<p>She saw the creature before her utter a bellowing roar that pierced right through the sides of her head to penetrate a part of her mind that had just before almost ceased. If her ears could shriek or her eyes roll back they would have as the sensation of noise pressed into her and echoed and re-echoed in the sphere of her skull.
<p>And it raged against the soft earth that remained, ripping forth clods of dirt and scattering them against trees in search of the retreating foe. But it was gone, hidden and disjointed. Its movements slowed as it realized the futility of this course of action. The creature took one, shuddering breath, a blast of heather and deserts and roasted bones that traveled, fog-like across what was left of the grove.
<p>The scent effused her nose and traveled down into her mouth as well, awakening two more regions she had shortly lost. Though she gasped in air, she did not truly breathe, the taste of ash mingled with the heady scent of immortality that hung through the area, had she been able to she may have called the odor foul and strange, but no words pushed past her lips.
<p>It heaved with exhaustion as it witnessed the sundered earth around it. It sagged for a moment, head bowing low in a minute of reflection. When it finally raised its eyes, it seemed to finally notice the stone statues around it for the first time. With emotion akin to sadness it examined the statues, assessing each one in a singular prismatic claw, vaguely regretting its violent actions against the other unfortunate stones. The rest of the appendages remained deathly still as the face concentrated on each individual statue, willing something intangible back into the stone. The result was always the same, however, after trembling for a few impossibly long seconds, the statue would always fade, destined for some other existence. With startling patience the creature continued his labor, making the man who lay in the ivy, and the man with his sheltered head vanish. Day broke, and the world modulated from painted darkness to the somber brightness of morning as she lay motionless, cheek to the earth, back fetally curved into the crook of a tree at the edge of a grove. The creature's arm finally reached her limp, icy body and she suffered the heat and the intensity of the claw which scorched and cut and scathed sensation back into her body. She finally cried out, a harsh, grating rasp that seemed to cut at the back of her teeth, and with shock and amazement the creature beheld her fluttering stone chest and lank gray hair. Though it had burned and seethed, the claw had left no mark upon her inflexible body. Lifting forth her body with infinite tenderness the creature raised her to its terrifying visage. She tried to look away, but she could not, her instinct still dead within her. It contracted the upper part of its brow to reveal many enormous eyes that stared. It looked strangely human, almost, but as she looked closer she could see the world, reptile, bird, fish, plant, particle, everything reflected in that face. It inhaled, perhaps in awe as it took in what was before it, and finally it inhaled once more, momentous and hungry, inflating its great swan neck with far more than simple air and breathed into her rumpled form.
<p>Immediately she regretted having the burden of sensation again. The creature's breath seeped in through her nostrils, its first gasps infusing her lungs, wearing away the strange hardening that had taken place, numbing blood vessels and air and breaking and shattering old stone, ripping it away bit by bit and knitting it back into the flesh that it used to be. Yet still her lungs remained cold and useless. A second breath seared through her like a bolt of fire, seemingly cauterizing all the wrong that had just occurred and restoring warmth and causing an infant roar to bubble forth from her throat. Such intense pain followed throughout her body as her functioning lungs brought the creature's breath to each organ and to the tip of each finger and toe. Each blood vessel surged with life, numb, and then fiery, the scorching needles pricking every inch of her body from the inside out, feeling as if it were threatening to draw the very blood that was restored out of her body. Her screaming ceased just then, the pain so appalling. She felt as if she were expanding, her skin now too tight for the surge of fluid beneath it. Her nails bit into her skin to try to release the pressure, and one after the other, spasms overtook her as her body involuntarily jerked in the creature's hand; a heroic effort kept her from dropping the few feet to the earth below. She felt like dying, for her resurrection seemed a worse fate than the oblivion from whence she came. The concurrent waves of pain suddenly ceased as she thought herself dead once again.</div>

						<div class="nanotitle">Land of Lost Ideas</div>
						<div class="nanodescription"><p>I was terribly afraid of not hitting the word count by finishing my story too early. Thus, a then excellent idea (let's call it 'character development') basically got out of control and nothing coherent happened. I believe this was also the year I sat funny on the edge of the bed for the entire month and had... body problems. I DID NOT COMPLETE THE PLOT OF THIS NOVEL, EVEN THOUGH I HIT 50,000 WORDS.</p>

							<p>Summary: The most powerful man in the world has access to all that is lost. (Alternately) Eccentric man has too much power. Oh dear.</p>

						<p>Influences: Forgetting dreams, The Jabberwocky, a very bad fever</p></div>
						<div class="nanochapter">	<p>Eriom had been gone for three days. The trip to and from Cran was a clear four days on foot, taken at a leisurely pace. It was slightly shorter, otherwise, even if there were long breaks for meandering, and meals. 
<p>Calan had given his son enough money for a week, or more, if he spent it wisely. But, he knew he would not, and that the road would take its toll. 
<p>For Calan, they were two days of wrung hands, and iron-clad jaw lines. He had spent late hours at the atelier, worrying over jewels and knives through the last of the fast moving light. His hands burned from the crystal dusts, and his eyes watered, for more than one reason. However, he found that it was better than coming home to see a spot missing at his table. The two commissions had come in close together, and they were finished promptly, long before their due date. However, Calan thought his work sloppy, and each day, he would sand, polish and scrape off jewels, grain by grain, until they were too small and no longer perfect, scratched from luster, out of recognition. He would sigh, or storm and then he would begin with another gem, shoving the old one into a forgotten drawer, before repeating the process on another, until it, too, lay as a discarded carcass deep in a cabinet. It was a costly trip for Calan. It was nearly night before the last clack of a jewel on wood sounded. Calan looked into the drawer. It was bloated with scratched and tarnished gems. He had ruined more gems in two days than he had in the past year. A look of disgust and annoyance passed over his face, and he skimmed the surface of the larger jewels. Some were still useable, if they were cut into upsetting-no, interesting-no, unique shapes. He told himself, as he plucked a few forth and pocketed them, that he would think about them tonight, and work on them later. They were not ruined, they simply needed a bit of refinement. Why, in fact, a few of these had not been cut very badly at all. Scratches only lined one side, and those could be hidden. He remarked to himself that a rough re-examination of his goods was all he needed to worry about while he went on his way home
<p>The concern on Sabella's face was enough of a reminder of this. As the stores of jewels depleted, drop by drop, she would pat his back, sighing that Eriom was fine, and that greeting him with a pile of ruined gems that he would have to cut and grind into miniature, useable shapes was no gift at all. She gave off the aura of having trust in Eriom, though Calan knew as well as she that it was a brave face she put on in front of her husband. He was beginning to let himself trust her, if only for a few more hours of sleep.
<p>"Is Eriom coming back today?"
<p>Sindra was quick to break the fragile stability her mother tried to create, and Calan visibly slumped back in his chair.
<p>"He'll be back tomorrow, if not today."
<p>She prodded at a biscuit with her fork while mulling this over in her head.
<p>"Oh, darn." She put her fork down and looked towards the roof contemplatively. "It was nice having more than two biscuits."
<p>Lina chuckled at this, and Sindra gave her a perplexed look. Lina covered her mouth to stop the exploding smile from becoming visible and noisily slid a dish towards her sister to cover up her low chortling.
<p>"Lina, tell us about your day."
<p>"Ho, ho," her breast vibrated with suppressed laughter which returned like a spring, "it was fine." She took a breath and continued while her mother stared at her pointedly. "I went to the tanner's shop and bought a patch of leather to sew onto the knees of some of the work pants, so the cloth would not get all torn and ruined."
<p>Comments were thrown back and forth across the table in a vain attempt to fill the nagging hole Eriom's absence created. There were only so many things that could be said about days and activities and the weather before the well ran dry. They lapsed into a stifling silence, eventually, after the meat was cut and the apple tart was still cooling on the counter; the only remaining topic, which sat right before them, refused to be discussed.
<p>Sabella stood by, full of ideas that would turn to vapor before they reached her lips. She seemed like a fish, bubbling aimlessly from the mouth, without a single thought making it out. Sindra's story of how she had gotten herself hurt somehow (again) had ended long ago, and she decided to instead busy herself with the pastry that was sitting patiently in the corner to be consumed. Calan's eyes followed her as she rose and grabbed a long knife from a drawer and firmly cleaved through the flaky crust she had spent hours creating.
<p>"I made this with apples from next door."
<p>She remembered talking about this moments before, and everybody smiled, politely. She found that she could not stop.
<p>"The Renikans have good apples. They should consider growing an orchard."
<p>A general, familiar hum of agreement passed among the people sitting around the table as the nibbled at the corners of their pastries. Sindra told the tale of how she would fallen and hurt herself while she chewed on a corner of dried apple noisily. Sabella admonished her, again, and Lina chortled politely. After revolutions and rotations, Sabella forgot if she was truly eating her tart, or whether she was simply bringing it to her lips before putting it down again. Up and down. Finally, Calan rose, his own section only partly finished. All eyes riveted on him, turning with the subtle hope that he would somehow release them from the table.
<p>"Thank you, darling, that was very delicious. I think I will retire now, if that's quite alright."
<p>Sabella nodded, and Calan strode out of the room, the breath of air in his wake restoring Sabella's breath, or mental presence, to her. She watched Calan lumber down the hall, weights on his legs, and with a murmur he wandered into the storytelling room, the orange hues emanating forth from it told her that the brazier was burning. She looked to Lina and Sindra, who were both looking at their cuts of pastry, as if seeing them for the first time.
<p>"Let's go, I am sure your father has an excellent story, tonight." There was some hesitation, and she even heard it in her own voice. "We can help him work on it for Eriom, for when he gets back."
<p>The plates were forgotten on the table and the three women moved as one towards the silent glow.
<p>"Calan?"
<p>He looked imposing and dark against the chair he sat in. He watched the flames moving, and she saw them moving on his eyes as well, orange and brown smudges against dark, shining shapes. She took a seat next to him, in another chair, and Sindra, wanting to sit before him for a better view, suddenly decided otherwise, once she saw the look on her father's face. Lina took her decorously by the hand towards another seat nearby vaguely removed from the husband and wife, who were almost touching at one spot near the shoulder.
<p>"Sabella," her name, somehow, pushed something within him, a strange and enigmatic switch that somehow brought his hand from rest at his side into his pocket. It produced two withered jewels, an humming amethyst, badly scratched to the point of irrecognition, and a ruby that was in a similar condition.
<p>"I am going to tell you a story."
<p>He clasped her hand. Tears began to fill her eyes, as she looked down at his great hand eclipsing hers, but his voice remained even. The fires reflected in his eyes had turned the glassy and smooth like pearls. His story began with a boy, and his family, and the most beautiful girl in the world. This boy, who knew he was nothing special, was loved by the beautiful girl, but he never knew it. She followed him around the world, watching and aiding him when she could before coming to him, finally, in his hour of need, when the greatest journey of all came to an end, and another began. It was a simple story, but Sabella knew its significance, and filled in each of the little breaks, mentally, with the cruelty and hardship and rage she remembered, so clearly. It was his way of telling her, his way of communication, that that was how he felt, that he was alright. The jewels in his hands were now held up to the firelight, and they glittered despite their clouded surfaces. If anything, those shards of light were that much more precious.
<p>"This is you; you are my humming jewel. You were the true treasure at the end of my journey. No matter what, no matter how much happened or how much was lost, it was worth it."
<p>She nodded, unable to find her voice. Tears blurred her vision. The song of the humming amethyst sung in her head, pure and clear through her tears, perfect in every way. More than anything, she wanted to say something in return that would show her husband how much his words had meant to her. When she could not, she instead reached for the ruby, resting in the palm of his other hand.
<p>"You are my ruby, scratched, but whole. Your brilliance may have been hidden, for a time, but I knew it was, no, I know it is there. Always."
<p>A smile, warm, but muted, crept up his lips, but he removed his wife's hand from atop the glowing ember of a gem. For just one moment, a memory, a spark, a pink thread of light held their two hands together over the burning ruby. A knot was tied, their fingers, their fate, and he spoke his words like his story, spun and strong and true.
<p>"No, this is Eriom, his vibrant heart. It is my sincerest hope that there is a ruby to match his own, somewhere at the end of the road. May he find happiness, without the ache of the soul atop the ache of the heart."
<p>His hand closed atop the gems, and they were placed back into his pocket. The silence returned, beside the crackle of the fire. But, rather than straining to fill the void, the realization dawned, on each member of the family, that there was nothing left to say.
<p>There was a soft push against the door. The latch yielded easily, bending unnaturally out of shape as if melted by a small sun. The still figures in the room down the hall seemed to sense it, for it was the only disturbance in the circle of calm. It was not a good feeling, it was a deep feeling of malaise that made each member of the family shift uneasily in place. Calan rose, finally, once the shadow beyond the phantasm of imagination had seeped in, and the door had clicked closed. Sabella looked over her shoulder, seeing nothing, but knowing somehow that someone had invaded her home. Her stomach clenched harder than she thought possible, and it compressed her inwards like a wound. Calan's hand brushed against her shoulder as he left the story room, and she could still feel the memory of the spark, and the image of the gem, whole, for just one moment. Lina rose, moving to take his place while Sindra made restless noises, gritting her teeth like a feral thing that sniffed and smelled the odd sweaty scents of the unknown.
<p>There was someone there. He neither knew the who, nor the where, but the clench of his jaw and the pulse in his temple told him everything he needed to know. Calan opened his mouth, but then thought better of it. It would make the first move, whatever it was, and Calan wanted to make sure he stayed on more stable, familiar grounds than his invader-no, his enemy. There were no sounds of footsteps on the wood of the floor, no familiar creaking, no odd give or take. The hallway was dark, but the light from the kitchen was still glowing softly against the evening gloom. A dark silhouette, cut across with bands of yellow and gold stepped into the side of the light. Its shape was still molded out of dark, but there was a visible arm, curved from a velvet smooth sleeve.
<p>"Excuse me."
<p>Its head rose, the golden corn silk fall of hair sweeping up as the eyes turned to face Calan. The shape morphed from profile, to confrontation, to profile once again, never quite staying still. Calan knew he had been spotted, in spite of the cover of darkness, and the familiarity of his own home. He straightened himself, not remembering when he would started slumping and slinking. He did not move, hidden as he was in the dark, but the straightening movement seemed imposing.
<p>"What do you want?"
<p>It seemed a fair question.
<p>"I am looking for something."
<p>The last word vibrated and shifted through the air. It made Calan's heart stop, and the breath fall out of him, icy and stale. The being who stood half in light, half in darkness spoke calmly, and without hesitation. He took a step forward, assuredly, deeper into Calan's home. Calan wanted to return the gesture with confidence to the point of foolhardiness. But he could not, he found, fight the piercing chill in his bones that left him breathless and meek, cowering on the outside, if not on the inside as well. 
<p>"I am looking for you."
<p>A finger rose, dredged forth from the blackness, and it jabbed towards Calan. It looked sharp, menacing and cold, more frightening than any weapon. He could feel his strength leaving him, his vision blurred, and he leaned against a wall for support. Ever so slightly, something within him moved. A groan lurched out of him, and he felt a combustion, an explosion of energy in him. 
<p>An image, something precious, the feel of two lips on his own, the sweet pressure, the exotic tastes, was all that existed in that moment. 
<p>It was the most cruel feeling he had ever felt. The explosion vanished, as quickly as it came, taking with it the white memory and leaving behind an yawning void in its wake. It left him weak kneed, diminished in some intangible way, but not knowing how. He was suddenly very afraid, as the realization set in that he was no longer in his home, on his terrain, in his world. He whimpered, he could not help it, as he clutched and grasped for what was lost.
<p>He could see faintly, now, the gray lower portion of its lips, dark and light, frosted, drinking something in, light, like vapor. They moved, but the words that followed them ached out, slowly, turning and turning in the air before they finally hit Calan's ears like thunder.
<p>"Show me your work."
<p>The shock of those words burned some strength back into Calan, but it left as suddenly as it had come. The request, more of an undeniable order, was the only thing he could think about. His mind refused to wander into the territory of consequences, denials, territory pulled and pushed into the distorting prism of fear.
<p>But, Calan was no longer alone, Sabella had risen, and strode out, hips squared, chin up, the action of waiting, and not knowing, too much to bear. Sindra moved to follow her, but Lina held her back with an arm, the fleeting ghost of fear on her face ready to unhinge and unanchor her from this world. It was only her arm, now, placed gently atop Sindra's breast, which kept her eyes aflame, moving steadily from her mother and father in the hallway, and the unknown shade cast in glow. Her father slowly slumped forward, sapped of strength, but her mother righted him with a swift lift of an arm. It took on a more gentle aspect as it lay on his shoulder, words were whispered in his ear, and he did not see that her lips, too, were quivering.
<p>"Calan, go."
<p>He nodded, but Lina was not sure if she knew what sort of non-verbal communication was happening just beyond her perception. The silk of hair wisped back out of the light in the kitchen, receding back beyond vision, and Calan strode shakily, but with purpose, into the kitchen. Sabella disappeared, Lina catching only a figment from the corner of her eye. She was unsure of where to go, whether anyone recognized the situation, the person or thing that was in their home. A moment passed in hesitation, then a gruff arm, and something hard and small, pushed her back into the story room.
<p>"Stay there."
<p>Something murmuring, glittering in the dark caught her eye, but it disappeared into the hem of her mother's dress. Where the hand had touched her, something remained, also, but it tumbled into a pocket, tucked away so that all she felt was the slightest pressure at her thigh. She turned to her right one last time to see the face, ghostly pale, skeletal and clear, move suddenly from darkness into light. It saw her, and for that one moment when her pale eyes touched his, she felt one single squeeze of her heart.
<p>"Sindra, come here." Lina pulled the straining, frantic girl in with her, and her mother closed the door in front of them. She pulled herself, as well as Sindra into a chair, visibly covering and restraining her sister with what little strength she had.
<p>"Sindra, Sindra, I am going to tell you a story."
<p>The fighting, the fear, the unexpected sting of tears against both Sindra's and Lina's eyes ceased, for just a moment, and it was enough for Lina to gather her thoughts.
<p>"There once was a small boy, named Eirabael, who lived long, long ago." She tethered flying memories together, cobbling thoughts and images from a time before Sindra existed into a cohesive tale. Her voice soaked up the encroaching darkness, the warmth by the fire and the sound of a story the only things in existence. Words from her father, from Eriom condensed, and her thoughts strayed to him, alone with whatever that was. Her voice rose for an instant, and Sindra tensed, but it was lowered once again, drawing on the warmth of the fire for steadiness. She knew, if nothing else, that this night would not need to be tethered, it would remain buoyed in her thoughts, for better or for worse.
<p>Her mother's footsteps creaked on the floorboards in a distinctly human manner outside of the room. Every so often it would interrupt a word, or a thought. But she paid no heed, her thoughts were focused elsewhere like a beam, the razor edge of her sanity slowly shifting in and out of reliability.
<p>The headed towards the light in the kitchen, lurking like a cat, dark and feline. She saw the unearthly man at the table with her husband, his back to her, his great, imposing stature bringing beads of sweat to her brow. An assortment of their silverware was placed between them, and Calan's hands shook as he spread them out carefully, not moving a single one out of its place.
<p>"Show me your gems."
<p>The man was not like anything Calan had seen before. Maybe it was his blurring vision, or the strange sapping feeling moving through his bones, but he knew he would seen this face before, and he knew that it was not a face to be trifled with. A flash of an image suddenly confronted him as the man sat down before him, a blown candle. The world went dark for a moment but the color slowly returned over a short period of time.
<p>"I cut gems into these spoons, these forks, and this knife handle."
<p>He had collected his named objects before sitting, selecting the best of his work to satisfy whatever impulse this man had. Each object was examined, the flowing cuffs of the man's dark robe sweeping over each one but never quite touching any of them. A knife, a spoon, a fork and a bowl were slowly lifted to be examined by a frown. Some of his best work, some of the clearest jewels ever harvested from the earth were placed down meticulously, rejected with the utmost courtesy. The man did not need to say it, it was written on his face.
<p>"No."
<p>His iron, mercury eyes bored into him, they shifted silver and brown and emerald all at once. Calan rose quickly to fetch more possible candidates. He returned somewhat less decorously with less ordinary pieces, an earring, a brooch, a comb. They were placed down scattered, the neat lines of forks and spoons broken by unruly jewelry. These, too, were picked over carefully, but, likewise, they too were rejected, in the end. An inner furnace began to boil within Calan, it was nervousness, rather than any unnatural fire, but it was uncomfortable, all the same.
<p>"Ah."
<p>He stared at his shaking hands, unable to stop them despite the fact that they were folded, clasped until the tendons popped forth from the skin like bones. He tried to think of better works, more satisfying gems that might catch this person's fancy so that he would finally leave them alone. No ideas came, and finally, his reply came forth as a question.
<p>"What are you looking for?"
<p>There was a bated pause. Calan's breath caught in his throat and he quickly filled in the empty space.
<p>"I will show you some of my uncut gems, I can make them into any form you want. Just say the word and it'll be done."
<p>A key was pulled out of Calan's pocket, after many attempts, it almost fell, and he moved over to a pair of locked cabinets, tucked away in a corner beneath a chair. The lock clicked off mercifully and Calan shoved two hands in, grabbing two fistfuls of gems. He pushed the trinkets and utensils to the side, making way for the small fortune of precious stones. They tumbled like prismatic rain, precious gems stuck to small bits of stone, cloudy sapphires and diamonds blending into their sister rubies and emeralds. The man took a longer time, carefully examining each gem, but in the end, as his search became faster and more cut-throat, Calan realized that what he was doing was not what was wanted. Again, there was a full stop, in which the world held its breath.
<p>"What do you want?"
<p>Those eyes rose forth from the table, their gaze sweeping up, their color changing like seasons. It took Calan a moment to realize that he was not being look at, he was being looked through. Its lips, slightly parted, let out a single breath, as still as winter.
<p>"This."
<p>The word spun through the air, looped around its rising finger, spear-pointed and cold. A tangible force pushed against Calan, he rose in an agonizing moment, when the flames in the brazier stopped moving. A cold burning, like a question exploded in Calan's heart, and he screamed silently, his breath unable to come. The world went blue, and then dark, and the explosion continued, contained and irreversible. Each thought he clung to, each moment of peace he tried to find, whether it be within a story by the fire, or the feel of a perfectly smoothed edge, was ripped out, immolated mercilessly. He did not know how long it could last, how he could avoid the random leaps of thought, the weakness in his need for comfort. His memories were all he had, he fought tooth and nail to suppress them, bury them deeper so they would not surface, but it was useless. 
<p>But, as if against its nature, it suddenly stopped. His throat closed, as the sudden sense of loss, far greater than what he had experienced before, opened up within him, scarred and bleeding. He was on his knees, looking at the floating, dissolving face that moved in and out of light from over the edge of the table.
<p>"W-who are you?"
<p>Everything stood still, except Calan's own erratic breathing, a shade moved from the edge of his vision, ghosts from the past, his vanishing thoughts, he did not know, and something changed. He was not sure what, but it was fleeting, and immediate. He looked towards the being, once again, after his eyes swung away for just a moment. Its lips were still, and its hair, soft and free, somehow seemed to soak up all the light in the room. He saw it, and it blinded him.
<p>"This."
<p>The cosmos gathered around him, spun, imploded, and his world shattered. The explosion happened again, the destructive and consuming fire. Time reversed itself, and at once, all the strange, foreign things he could not remember returned to him, too fast, too fast, the broken mirror of memory repieced itself, shards flying in, gathering from the scattered, dusty corners of existence. A sound pulled through the air, and Calan realized that it was his own. His eyes flared with illumination, and for an instant, he could see that the finger, the strange and devastating finger, was not mere flesh at all. The thing, a man, an angel of blinding, incredible beauty and an aura that showed about them a million floating shreds, ghostly birds. In that strange, lengthened moment, the world stopped again as realization set in, and an infinite amount of thoughts spun through Calan's head, and all at once, he could feel the pair of lips on his own, the warmth of the fire on his face and the lace of story in his hands.
<p>And then they were gone. 
<p>"N-no."
<p>Fizzled up like smoke, rusted and tarnished out of existence, he knew that they still lived on, somewhere, but they were irretrievable. He knew exactly what he would lost, but was powerless to stop it. It was the most cruel act of all.
<p>It was crippling. He could not move, could not think, could only see the abject nothingness without and within. The hand, no, the cruel blade, curved and thirsty, moved closer through the air with painful slowness. It came chillingly close, and Calan's eyes followed it, its proximity paralyzing and overwhelming. There was a firm screech, as if it had cut through stone, rather than cloth, and a pocket in his shirt was no more. A single crystal, the scratched amethyst, fell free, clattering onto the table. It hummed, softly, unaware, unwavering, untouched.
<p>"N-no!"
<p>He blinked, once, and he saw a storm of shades, movements out of every corner of his eye that reeled and flew and lurched, a shape seeped forth into the kitchen, and he thought, for certain, that there were more, coming to finish the job. The single flame in the brazier caved in on itself, flaring now like a small star, furious and blue and casting an iridescent light against Calan's face, casting his shadow to twice his height, looming to claim him. The sorcerer reached forward, bending over to retrieve the fallen crystal from the ground. It shimmered softly, captivating, humming with enchantment. Calan wanted, more than anything, for that man to not touch that crystal, take it from him, the last thing that was truly, only his. No, more than that, he wanted to keep his wife, and his wife's memory safe. He reached forward, but it was useless, all of his strength had been sapped from him, and he felt like an empty husk, incredibly spent, and unable, even, to muster the strength to breathe. 
<p>For a moment, the sorcerer's eyes stilled, and the shades stopped moving, frozen in mid-air. There was only the single, larger shade now present in the room, and moving slowly out of the dark. 
<p>It was a familiar shape, he thought it was an idea, conjured forth from the crystal, his last memory come to haunt him before it, too, was destroyed.
<p>"N-NO!"
<p>	But, it was no shade. Even from his vantage point, splayed on the ground, he could see his wife clearly in the threshold of the kitchen, moving swiftly, like a feral cat, the shine of a blade in her hand. The sorcerer, captivated by the amethyst at his feet did not notice, did not sense the fluid movement in the room.
<p>It all happened so quickly, in that moment of crises, when the furnace roared, a rupture of sound and ferocity exploded, all at once.
<p>"Mother! Father!"
<p>First, there was the sound of the door, clattering off its hinges, drawing everyone's eyes to the sound. Eriom burst in at a run, seeing the hem of his mother's dress in the kitchen. The sorcerer saw her as well, and she leapt towards him, roaring, yet graceful, her movements the speed of the ghosts around her. But she was not fast enough. The sorcerer simply turned, lifting a hand, and she plunged onto it, the silver dagger. Her own, black and razor-sharp, clattered to the ground uselessly as her eyes opened and her mouth curved into a small 'oh.'
<p>Not a single muscle moved in the kitchen, not a single breath was taken. It was only after the moment of shock had passed, politely, like a knock on a door, did her face contort into a rictus of pain. She clutched herself, and she staggered backwards. Her face, turned and frozen, fell backwards, into the threshold, and the memory of the unnatural agony, just beyond the wooden beam would haunt Eriom forever. She screamed, one, final scream, and she collapsed, no wound in her belly, but with eyes that no longer saw anything of this world. Her ghost came soaring out of her, another pair of wings in the furious black storm hurtling through the kitchen. The only light, the shining amethyst on the ground, was snatched with an unnatural fury and jammed into a slot in the knife. I vibrated, instantly, and Calan, beset by the twin tragedies, thrown halfway into madness, could only will denial, with all his strength that was left in him.
<p>"No!"
<p>In this dark, spinning world, there only existed two people, Calan, and the sorcerer. Within the storm, the maelstrom of scraps and birds, the sorcerer lifted Calan's face in his cold, deadened hands. "Where is the other?"
<p>He could still feel the amethyst humming, calling for its partner, woven in story.
<p>"Mother!"
<p>Eriom rushed towards the woman in the threshold. A sister cry, rearing out of the story room chased Sabella's final scream, and a swift body shoved past Eriom, who was already headed towards the kitchen. The cyclone world scattered, as Sindra intercepted the sorcerer's leg, biting it viciously with her teeth. She had caught him by surprise, shattering the world he had created, but the surprise was short-lived, and not enough. Another swift arc of the hand, a string of curved light, and she, too, was dispatched. She cringed, as the blade passed through her, but she refused to scream. Her eyes clamped shut, and the muscles pulled and convulsed under her skin as she tried to keep them under control, force herself to fight. She held on with all her might, raking at the sorcerer's leg until her last breath, and then, she, too, screamed, unable to bear it any longer. He cast her off with a swift blow, knocking her away with enough force to slam her small body into the kitchen wall. Her still form lay next to her mother's, cast away like some rag doll. Her golden locks covered her face, and she no longer moved.
<p>Lina was right behind her, reaching out a beseeching hand. Both she and Eriom arrived in the kitchen at the same time, hunched over the two prone bodies, already cold and pale. Their father, face-down, further away in the corner of the kitchen, seemed to be in a similar, if not worse state.
<p>"R-run..." it whispered, but Eriom and Lina could not.
<p>"Mother, Sindra, are you, say something, please, mother, Sindra, mother, anything" Eriom clasped at their hands, shocked by their stillness, unable to believe what was before him. His words mumbled off into nothingness. Lina could not say anything at all, her great eyes enormous, and her breath hoarse. She simply patted at her sister's hand, frantically, while running another over her cold, horrified face. The swarm of black birds, brewing in the corner of the kitchen, stood forward, extended, and finally, Eriom and Lina found themselves facing what had dispatched their sister and mother. 
<p>"Give me its sister" it stated, quite simply, but the threat, the fear and the wrath in those words stopped Eriom and Lina cold. They felt the edge of what their mother and sister had experienced, and already, they could feel it trapping them, consuming and paralyzing them for the kill. Eriom could not find a coherent thought in his head, but Lina clasped her hand over her heart, shaking her head feverishly. The sorcerer took a step towards them, and Lina rose, grabbing Eriom's hand and dashing in one fluid movement towards the unhinged door.
<p>"Give it to me or I shall take what is mine!"
<p>The voice followed them, dogging them for the second of movement they were afforded. All too soon, something cold, burning, intangible slammed into Eriom, and he thought it the end. Lina's hand was ripped forth from his, and they both screamed, mightily. There was a blur of movement, and Eriom's side hit the ground, hard. He picked himself up, scrambling to his feet as best he could, before running into a wall and collapsing once again. The world went black and the oily colors that returned spun and swarmed with wraith-like images. Lina was nowhere to be found, within the morass, though he heard her screaming, she seemed to have been pushed far away from him. He ran towards her, or where he thought she was, tripping over himself, feeling the blood rush in his neck; she must have been caught in the sorcerer's grasp. He thought he saw her outline, cutting against the fraying image of the sorcerer, the source of the flayed shadows. She screamed, she cried, and wriggled and writhed in his grip. He struggled to hold her still, and Eriom lunged toward him. The river of shades grew thicker, and they flew against him, pushing him away. His disorientation brought him backwards and confused, and he found that he could no longer see Lina, or the sorcerer. 
<p>"I will never let you, never!"
<p>Lina's words pierced through the swarming darkness, between her ragged gasps and screams. Eriom oriented towards them, swiveling and running towards the sound. He broke through the wind, diving out the side of the bubbling shades to see Lina, finally, face to face, out of the grasp of the sorcerer. She was breathing hard, he seemed unperturbed.
<p>"So be it!"
<p>He raised his finger, pointed it at Lina, and imperceptibly, the world went cold. If Eriom had thought Lina's keening was anything before, this proved him wrong. She was rocked, silently, on her feet, and Eriom rushed to her. Something jeweled and crimson glowed in her breast, shining and pulsing against the dark stream emanating from the sorcerer's finger. He tried to lunge through it, interrupt the agony that had brought great tears to his sister's eyes.
<p>But she pushed him away.
<p>He would never thought his sister had the might, but he was launched clear across the room, as she doubled over in pain. He reeled like a prisoner, bound by shackles of pain, the world went sideways, and everyone was larger, suddenly. The curtain of her hair fell over her eyes as she dropped to her knees. The sorcerer strode the last steps to Lina, and raised her face with his hand.
<p>"It is mine. Give me the jewel."
<p>Lina let out one last gasp, the final vestige of what was truly her, before the rage, the pain in her eyes was replaced with cool serenity. She rose, graceful and immortal, in that second, and looked him directly in the face. The radiating ruby in her breast sparkled, shone brilliantly, for just a moment, and he hesitated, for just a moment, as she got onto her feet. Her legs were shaking, barely able to hold her up, but she looked poised atop them. Her voice, strange and imperious was alive and vibrating.

<p>"So be it."
<p>As if invoking her last rites, she closed her eyes, and gave in entirely. A storm of hair, her curls flaying white in the air, she barreled through the sorcerer, a crescent curve like a whirling top, leaning into the fall. The phantasmal knife, waiting, accepted the sacrifice as it pierced cleanly through her, the flaming ruby now buried deep into the blade. Lina made one, final noise, Eriom could not tell if it was a whimper, or a sigh, and she was sloughed off, like a second skin.
<p>A radiant light, silver and blue burned through Eriom's eyelids, seared the entire house with blinding beams. Eriom's vision dissolved into whiteness, the last image drawing itself in the blankness the look on his sister's face, triumph, or regret, a confusion of memories and the final sense of the most irrevocable loss.
<p>But it was the sorcerer's outline that returned first. Eriom felt his way onto the ground, reeling out from nothingness back into the corporeality of his home. The sorcerer was looking forward, searching for something outside of the door. The dagger, now very visible, cleanly separated from the hand that held it, was held loose in his grip, a single amethyst, vibrating softly, and a single ruby, humming, in unison, were studded into its hilt. Something caught the sorcerer's attention, a minute detail, best taken care of. He turned to Eriom, crawling on the floor, and closed the distance between them. The knife was raised, brought close to the sorcerer's face, perhaps for examination.
<p>Then, his eyes, strangely clear and shockingly blue, turned to Eriom. They viewed the specimen in front of them, and slowly, they changed, again, into a brown that Eriom had not seen. In a moment, they were familiar, the dark beetles, staring up from a field of wheat, holding out a beseeching hand.
<p>"I am very sorry."
<p>And then they turned away, once again, invisible.
<p>"I... I..."
<p>Eriom found his voice, finally, and suddenly, with it, came his rage, his indignation, his fury. He knew that this path was not a productive one, yet it seemed the only route to trace.
<p>"I will kill you!"
<p>On his knees, on his hands, with red stars exploding all over his vision he attempted to realize what exactly was happening. He clawed at the ankle in front of him, but it took him a second to realize that it was no longer there, the empty space in front of him collapsing noisily into place. His head lowered, just for that moment, rose once again, to see the last hem of the sorcerer's robe leave the front door, a shimmering flash of movement. A final lurch brought him face-to-face with nothing, the distance moving him to stunned stillness. It was then extraordinarily quiet, like the end of the world, as he realized, that, in fact, it was the end of his world.

Originally intended to be a mystical adventure through many lands, I ran into the problem of not including enough characters, again. More of a transition project, I'm still proud that I actually finished the entire plot like a good boy.</p>

							<p>Summary: A prince finds love four times before realizing he doesn't need it. (Alternately) HOW DARE YOU DITCH ME, BETHANY STARTIN!!!!!11!</p>
						
						<p>Influences: Bethany Startin</p></div>
						<div class="nanochapter"><p>Aevin jerked into a sitting motion too quickly and felt the stars spin. Nearby, his horse panted uneasily.
<p>The wan moonlight broke through the canopy of the trees. Aevin struggled to place himself. There was something strangely jarring that night, as if all his gilded misadventures before this moment had simply been dreaming. For all that was, they might have been. His vision cleared and he saw his hands; his nails were clean. 
	<p>"Hello?"
	<p>He called out towards the trees. Something seductively soft, but cold brushed across his cheek. He shivered beneath his warm leather cloak. A length of time dragged by, and the silence pulsed with nocturnal tension. Inconveniently, a truth from childhood tales confronted him: you can only sleep in the woods for so long before something tries to eat you. 
	<p>"Anyone?"
	<p>He'd felt, more than heard, the unusual movements of the leaves on the floor around him. There was a black breeze disturbing the litter that moved with far too much purpose to be natural.
	<p>"If you're, if you're... State your name! Friend or foe?"
	<p>He knew the answer already as he felt the wind become solid: the non-step of padded feet. 
<p>Abel, his horse skittered on his hooves as he bucked at his tether. Aevin didn't need more convincing. He groped for his satchel of belongings. Fumbling, he sprung to his feet and untied the knot he'd tied poorly earlier holding Abel to a tree. He thrust himself towards his horse and levered himself upwards as soon as his suddenly numb hands found purchase. Knocking his shin against the hardness of its saddle, his other foot kicking free an entangling blanket, he hoisted his weight onto the already moving horse. He didn't need to kick him forward. It was all he could do to try and settle his weight. He felt himself slipping but he threw himself in a random direction. It felt like sheer luck that he was on the length of his horse, or that the horse was even there at all 
	<p>"Go. GO!"
<p>Calm was fairly abandoned, though every sense sharpened just slightly with panic. Shadows moved from shadows and Aevin's last look back showed the bare lightness of bark obscured by the oppressive lurk of a darting shape.
	<p>The chase had begun.
	<p>A strange, keening howl pushed through the forest and followed Abel's frantic dash. The horse lunged to the left, to the right, crashed through branches and brambles. Aevin, already bleary with the night clung for dear life, ducking down, clasping at his satchel when it threatened to fly away while trying to not unbalance and fall himself. The chill of movement seemed to strip him to the bone, while all he could see, when he looked back, were gnashing white shards, as if the trees had grown teeth, and dead blobs behind them. 
	<p>"Abel," he gasped as the stinging branches whipped across his face, "Abel, are we going to die?"
	<p>The horse spoke no answer. It had settled in to an icy run, leaping over logs, jostling the brains within Aevin's head. The thickness of the air and the erratic beat of his heart disoriented him. For a moment, he tried to calm himself, mumbling that his pursuers would not relent if he clutched his horse's reigns harder. He risked one last look back, and the hungry dog faces, moving like raindrops in a storm, an inch or a mile behind him, scattered any sense he had left.
	<p>Sense did not lie within the plunging path Abel picked for him, and it was eaten clean away by the running animals behind him. He cowered down into a sensible shape, his head in Abel's mane. Where were they going? Only his horse knew.
	<p>Abruptly, the world felt empty under him, and dread rushed into the vacuum. A great, petrifying screech from his horse unlike any he had heard before caught up with his wits, and in that moment he knew he was in grave danger. There was no more horse to grab, and he was turning in the air. The leaf-covered ground interrupted further thought. He rolled over roots and through leaves and ended tilted with a thud against a shattered flask in his bag. All the breath wheezed out of him, and he thought it was his own scream that roared through the air around him.
	<p>But the scream was not his own. Deeper blackness threatened to overcome him. He knew, then, that the hot spray of blood on his cheek was not his, and that the horrendous gurgles and the triumphant growls came from the pack of beasts devouring his steed.
	<p>There was pain, but no time to know it. The whirl of leaves and tearing flesh were but meters away. It would not remain so. His body felt like lead, but there was no time to feel it. He moved towards a random light, thinking the stars in the sky had been shaken down. He pressed against trees, groped against the earth, crawled over a log until the light in his eyes consumed him.
	<p>"Be still. They will not come near the flame."
	<p>The voice broke the light, as if the arch of his body finally cracked, and unsensing night overcame him.</p> <br><br>

	<p>Aevin awoke, alarmed by the trick-death of dreamlessness. He immediately wished he hadn't. Pain stopped disguising itself in dark and wrapped shapes. His lungs forced him to suck in air as if he had never breathed before. Another mistake: immediately he knew as he gasped against pain. Noises clarified around him, but he could do little else save open and close his eyes, and breathe. Carefully.
	<p>He could have been paralyzed, like he was, back then, in that stony tomb of a castle. There was the same bland sky, parsed between leaves; there were the same, dreaded feelings creeping into his bones. A more sinister thought: had those simply been wild creatures, too hungry and too simple to miss such an easy meal? He had an impossible memory of a different palace, and an angry face ordering scarred and paid faces out into the night. The last night could have simply been another leg of the race, which had finally caught up to him. 
	<p>He opened his eyes, not realizing that he had closed them, and noticed where he was. There were no castle walls to escape, and no kind cousins to secret him through them in the moonless eye of the night. He remembered, then, that the previous days had sent him through towns, then, through forests. Yes, there was the scent of dew on leaves.  
	<p>Was it safe?
	<p>Something on two legs crunched towards him. A shuddering breath of relief came out of him when he realized that he was alive. "Do not move, quite yet. You are injured, and I need to know how."
	<p>His head turned towards the voice and the man accompanying it. He was tall. He thought it could have been the hazy outline of his father, until his eyes focused on the waving dark hair on his head and the cut beard and moustache that framed his mouth. It stood out starkly against his pale skin and shining eyes. Black eyes, he thought, white only in the trick of the dawn. 
	<p>"It is better that I do this while you are awake."
	<p>The man's silhouette fingers passed across him, a few inches above his body. He didn't know if it was his vision or the light, but nothing seemed to stay the same about the man that was treating him. The world around him was smeared; it drifted out of place, constantly. He thought, perhaps, that the night had robbed from him more than just his horse.
	<p>"Who are--"
	<p>At that moment he gagged, as if a stick had been shoved under his ribs. The man noticed and stopped, momentarily.
	<p>"Ryvlor. That is my name. I shall heal your wounds, now that I have found them."
	<p>Ryvlor. His hands were still, but Aevin knew that something was happening. Magic came in many forms: it was not Aevin's forte, but he could recognize its presence. The indeterminate thudding pain and ache in his body slowly lifted, as everything shifted back to where it should have been. It was uncomfortable, and the sound, like the churning of an upset stomach, was unnerving. There was no denying he already felt better, though. He let out a sigh as the clock within him sped up and he was knit back together. 
	<p>Ryvlor gave him one last appraising look. Vanity suddenly flushed him. He must have looked a mess. Certainly, the back of his tunic was probably scudded with dirt, and his hands, though not bleeding, anymore, still shook slightly. He raised them to stop them to his sea colored eyes and rubbed the last few floating stars out of them vigorously. The only sensible thing left on him was his dark hair, cropped warrior short: it was in no danger of change, no matter what the condition. Content with what he saw, Ryvlor's penetrating gaze seemed to cool. Aevin was relieved.
	<p>"A strange name, Ryvlor." Aevin took the opportunity to sit up, everything suddenly sharpening as the lead of his limbs shed like husks. 
<p>"But, what a fine art it is you practice. I thank you for using your talents to mend me. I am afraid that I arrived in somewhat miserable condition." 
<p>They were alone, in this small clearing, with a dying fire to keep them company.
<p>"You must have been what Abel was headed towards."
<p>The man was built like a hunter, lean muscle, with strong legs, days spent running over fallen logs, shooting the elusive deer. Had Aevin been standing, he thought he would have risen to the man's nose. It was not uncommon, Aevin reminded himself, for hunters to know the basic arts of healing. He realized that it was a hard life, alone, and one did not embark upon it unprepared. The man wore a sensible, albeit tattered outfit, a tunic tailored by a loving hand, ages ago, leather vest and boots, and pants patched with cliptrop threads, woven from strong fibers. Holding up those pants was a belt, attached to it a knife.
	<p>"There is no doubt. Your dead horse's sensibilities saved you. Woe to the creatures of the day, which abandon light, in the night."
	<p>"Dead." Aevin looked back towards where he imagined the steaming bones, the scattered bits of dried gore might have been, "yes."  Or had the night and the forest already reclaimed them?
	<p>Ryvlor left him, swinging towards the cooling embers of his campfire. Aevin watched him, the scene settling into place. 
	<p>How long had he been asleep? He wanted to guess that it was dawn, by the way the light moved through the branches around him, but he was not sure. Was it the next day? Or the next?
	<p>What was left of his pack lay next to him, crumpled by a log. He wasn't quite sure what could be saved from it, but it provided a pleasant distraction. A jerk of his wrists closed the distance between them. Ryvlor didn't seem to be in the mood for conversation.
	<p>All he had were relics, crushed, flimsy relics: a head of garlic, sprouting and green, a timeworn ivory compass that was older than the forest around him, three pretty stones, a blast pattern stain of liquid upon a bundle of clothes, and little shards of blue bottle that once contained a cousin's experimental spell from an age ago. These were the things he'd kept so near while he slept. But were these the necessary things to be grasped before his flight? A voice interrupted him, and he tucked the belongings back in place, seeing nothing spectacularly out of the ordinary.
	<p>"Where are you going?"
	<p>Ryvlor appeared as suddenly as he'd left.
	<p>"I-thank you for healing me. And, yes, it was indeed foolish of me to spend the night alone in the open. I didn't have a choice, really. There aren't any places near here to stay, and the journey through the forest is very long. Were I at home, my, I would have brought, I mean, I am no longer at home, and I need to remember that... Thank you again. How fortuitous of me to have run into you when I did."
	<p>"That is a kind thing for you to say. What were you doing?"
	<p>"Ah-" Aevin shifted, and began to rise, milling the answer on his tongue. There didn't seem to be a correct way to speak it. "I have no reason to, there isn't a, I shall not... why do you..." He tried to suppress the familiar annoyance, but it burped out in little half-chewed frustrations. He caught Ryvlor's stare.
	<p>"Forgive me, if I am direct," he explained, and with visible tension, began to loosen his limbs. The corners of his eyes came down a little less severely. "I am still, it has been, a long time since I have had the company of another person. I am curious, if it does not behoove you to tell me."
	<p>"And, how long have you been alone?" Ryvlor raised an eyebrow and Aevin quickly looked away, "Oh, never mind, how rude of me. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked. You don't look much older than I am. It probably doesn't matter." Aevin began taking a deep breath, but stopped himself.
<p>"Aevin. My name is Aevin"
	<p>He waited for the flicker of recognition, but it did not come. Carefully, he continued,
<p>"And I am from Talas." 
<p>Still nothing. 
<p>"The kingdom to the west."
	<p>He stuck out his hand, quickly, and it was taken.
	<p>"It is good to meet you, Aevin."
	<p>Aevin watched his face carefully, felt the grip in his hand for a sign, or some spark of unseen meaning. He could find none, and sucked in a sigh of relief.
<p>	"I am going to the journey seer's house at the other end of the forest, I seek a safe route through the northern mountains."
<p>	He saw Ryvlor look away for a moment, counting the leaves on the floor, shadows in his eyes plucking harps of thought. He had seemed so present for one moment, but he was gone the next.
<p>"I have watched many come through these woods. It is my home." he finally replied. Aevin smiled.
<p>"Did you save them, as well, when they fell off their horses?"
<p>Ryvlor, pointedly, did not smile.
<p>"No, they perished before I could help them."
<p>It struck Aevin how truly lucky he was.
<p>"Truly, you are a force of good in these evil woods. Whatever journey it is you take, you will be blessed."
<p>They sat in contemplative silence for a moment, Aevin gnawing his lip at the prospects of wandering back into the suddenly hostile woods alone, Ryvlor gazing raptly into nothing.
<p>"I... I will pay you for your services, should you lend them to me," Aevin stammered, unsure of how to proceed but unwilling to compromise his further well being for the sake of sounding awkward. "It is a great world out there, you are strong and knowledgeable and would be a... a great companion..." He broke off before he started blubbering.
<p>"I shall go, there is no need for you to pay me," he whispered; then, he was audible again, "You are well enough to walk?"
<p>Aevin tested his limbs. 
<p>"Yes, thank you."
<p>Ryvlor began packing what few belongings he had in his campsite.
<p>The work was quick and dirty, the brittle sticks of the night's fire were crushed, a sack, only somewhat larger than Aevin's own was used to contain flint, some hearty tubers, and a bundle of clothes. A sheet of skins, presumably what he had slept on, was rolled up and bound to the pack on his back. Finally, a knife was clasped onto Ryvlor's belt, next to a skin of water, and they appeared to be ready to leave before the sun reached noon. They stood before each other, deliberating whom it would be to leave, and Aevin stretched once more. Everything seemed to creak back into place.
<p>"Perchance we could look for where I'd come from. There are things there that I'd like to pick up."
<p>Ryvlor nodded and Aevin tried to orient himself. Ryvlor pointed in a direction, and indicated that perhaps the trail of snapped saplings and thrown leaves might indicate the path. The events of the night seemed unreal. There was no pain to remind him of his flight, and all Aevin could feel was a strange buoying hope. They worked their way forward, retracing Aevin's journey. Shortly, Aevin stumbled over something hard. 
<p>"Oh, my."
<p>Not a single bone remained to serve in memory of Abel. All that was left was a saddle, and a few tufts of mane. Abel had befallen a horrible fate. Aevin's guilt lanced him with a sharpness his bodily pain had lacked. His eyes suddenly felt heavy and he turned away. Abel had been his companion for a very long time, and Aevin did not know if his encounter with Ryvlor was some sort of balancing force. He walked past the strange emptiness quickly, not wanting to linger. Ryvlor cast a glance after him and reached towards the chewed saddlebags. Its useable contents, a length of rope, and some dried fruit, were stored away into his bag and he left the sad place, hurrying after Aevin in wide steps.
<p>Some distance later, picking their way through the snapped branches and chipped logs, Aevin stopped, looking to Ryvlor with heavy, liquid eyes.
<p>"What were those? What manner of beast would... despoil such a world?"
<p>Ryvlor stopped and met the sadness he saw without flinching. "They are creatures, like you and I. I do not know their names. I only know that they sleep in the day. They are hungry, and they hunt in the night."
<p>The sadness turned to astonishment, and this made Ryvlor look away.
<p>"I have lived here a long time, and I have seen them many times. I know they will not approach fire."
<p>The topic snapped shut neatly after them. They were quiet until they reached Aevin's camp. Though largely in disarray, most living items seemed to be intact. A tossed pot here, a tumbled pack there, the only thing that suggested anything beyond messy living was the fact that the bedroll was covered in unremarkable footprints. Aevin first reached for a sealed container and ate a piece of a hard cake within it. He realized, as his mouth worked the tough cake, that in this world there were things that ate, and things that got eaten. He took what little he could, without the aid of a horse to carry his belongings for him, and his companion helped him pack things away tightly on his back. It would be strange, he mused, to pick up and move, as if the previous night had never happened.
<p>Of course, things were different. Aevin felt an acute sense of mortality, and though he knew he was ready to continue, a part of him would not move. But, there was no choice to make. Aevin pulled out his compass and flipped open its covering.
<p>"What is that in your hand?"
<p>"Oh," The compass almost slipped free to drop to the scattered ground, but he caught it. Aevin never forgot that Ryvlor was there, but he did note that the man seemed to have varying intensities of presence. "It was a gift from my father. He said it was a family heirloom, and my brothers did not want it." He found the direction that pointed east, and snapped the ivory lid shut. "They're probably wasting the days away, surrounded by their numberless children in their," a spat word caught in his throat, "cottages, while I'm out here, searching for a route across a mountain." They began walking, though Aevin found it difficult to start his legs.
<p>"Do compasses interest you?" he asked, "It is of fine craftsmanship, and it is older than any of the other trinkets in our cottage."
<p>"How does it function?"
<p>"What a curious question." Aevin thought that perhaps the man had been away for too long. "You've never seen one before? How do you--well, never mind." His pace matched the briskness in his voice, "This compass is special. While most compasses point towards the south, to the center of the sea, the silver needle in this compass points towards the region of strongest magic. Before the wall of spears was raised, this compass would always remind us of Shirapan, the fierce power beyond our borders. However, now, it should point towards the wise woman's house." He smiled a small smile; "I am both glad and surprised it didn't swing immediately towards you. I know that your arts extend far beyond that of the standard woodsman." Finally, Aevin stopped. "Are you from Shirapan, by chance?" 
<p>It was slightly uncanny, the way Ryvlor was never far behind. At that moment, though, he stood beside Aevin with a quizzical expression upon his face.
<p>"I am not."
<p>"Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. I am grateful that you have chosen to accompany me. Do you want to take a look at my compass, then?"
<p>"It would please me to see it, yes."
<p>Aevin dropped the pale locket into Ryvlor's hand, and the man ceased all movement. An irrational dread seized Aevin, but before he knew it, the compass was back in his hands, and the walk once more continued in the direction of the swinging needle, as if nothing had ever happened.

						<div class="nanotitle">Postcards from Dane</div>
						<div class="nanodescription"><p>Postcards from Dane was a very time-sensitive piece. I realized that, mostly, this was the only time I would ever be able to write something so self-indulgent and whiny and possibly nonsensical. Set in 2010 in an unnamed Californian city that might rhyme with Pan Trancisco, Postcards from Dane follows one man's slow descent into (mostly self-inflicted) insanity. Part of my motivation in writing this was to deal with the sudden post-graduation anxiety/pointlessness that fell upon me while all my other friends were gainfully employed or blissfully unaware in school, still. It is, quite possibly, the only pornographic novel in which there is no physical sex between two different entities. </p>

							<p>Summary: Dane finds the paradox in loving himself while at the same time needing the love of others (Alternately) Ramblerambleramble ramble PHONESEX ramble rambleramble ramble gaythings ramble ramble nothing happens.</p>

						<p>Influences: David Sedaris, Fairy Armadillo, Saint Patrick</p></div>
						<div class="nanochapter"><p>Dane took off the headset, and had a sip from his thermos of tea. That was approximately the last call for the day, he imagined. His replacement would be coming in soon, probably before the next wave came. He dusted off the keyboard and his seat and then grabbed his coat from a hook on the door. Oh! He'd forgotten he had a message and a missed call from... Tiffany.
	<p>Hum.
	<p>"Hey, Dane, it's Stephanie. I really, really need your help to clean up from last night. Can you stop by? I can't do it all on my own."
	<p>From the sound of it, this was Stephanie's first time cleaning up after a gay party. Tiffany was either busy or hungover, and nobody else was available. Yes, although the gays were somewhat considerate, they were far from fastidious. He would stop by, because he was certain Charlie would not.
	<p>There was a knock on the door.
	<p>"My! My replacement is here early." Dane called, and when the door swung open, he stood face to face with Thomas.
	<p>His smile immediately dampened. Thomas saw this and placed his hands into his pockets.
	<p>"Thomas, your silly straight ass was sucking man face all night."
	<p>Getting right to the point, Dane mused. The Dane that was perhaps watching from very far away realized that the Dane facing Thomas was being a bit too annoyed for this. He was undergoing some sort of bleed over. He was wound up, and no matter how he tried to divorce himself from his call, it was hard to confront reality, in that small room. Where was the cool, smart phone actor now? Rather than the normal petty petulance, he seemed to be unnaturally angry. It was with visible effort that Thomas was pleasant. 
	<p>"I was only being polite."
	<p>"Yes, well, you were very polite, very obliging. How would that boy have felt, if he'd shoved his tongue into your mouth and you'd just walked away?"
	<p>Dane's accusatory tone was slightly grating. It wasn't the time for this.
	<p>"Dane, you're being unreasonable. You took me to that party, and you know as well as I do that I don't like going to those sorts of things."
	<p>"But why? You seem to get along with everyone quite well, rubbing up against their nasty parts."
	<p>Thomas was backing up. Before either of them knew it, they were out in the hall of the office, Dane spitting flecks onto Thomas's t-shirt.
	<p>"I hate these things precisely because they always sort out the same way!" Thomas raised his hands in explanation, "I didn't really have a choice!"
	<p>"You always have a choice!"
	<p>Thomas stopped just short of bumping into door 7. His tone changed and he puffed, "Oh, like how you chose to leave me there stranded without a ride?"   
	<p>"I wanted to see you have to go home with some boy, see what he thought once you said you were just kidding and it was all for fun." Dane scoffed. He thought he had the taste of blood in his mouth, spitting words that felt like carcasses. Thomas sidestepped the remark, though he still flinched.
	<p>"Well, isn't that just a bitch thing to do." Thomas stated simply, but with smoldering malice. He looked around and saw that gossipy little cracks had appeared in doors 8 and 9, and eyes were peeking out.  "I'm sorry you can't satisfy the most sexed demographic on earth."
	<p>"You think! You think that I!" Dane sputtered, "You think that I'm not satisfying? What the fuck are you saying?"
	<p>"I'm just saying it is NO surprise at all right now why you get the fewest call requests, out of all of us."
	<p>For some reason this calmed Dane, as he'd been expecting much worse. Some very oblong part of him remained intact and it seemed vitally important, though Dane couldn't put a word to it, right then.
	<p>"I'm more sorry for the fools that get you on when they call, you heartless bitch."
	<p>"Shriveled fuckwit."
	<p>"Rotten ballsac."
	<p>"CORPSEFUCKING FATASS."
	<p>"CHIMP RECTUM."
	<p>Things now tumbled into a steady downward escalation, where their insults gradually tapered off into silence.
	<p>"Pug-nosed cumdumpster..."
	<p>"Diseased strumpet..."
	<p>Then the silence between them was icy. They both realized that this was going nowhere, yet neither seemed to want to apologize. It was uncomfortably still until Ursula came around the corner and threw her shoes at them.
	<p>"Keep it down, please! We're trying to run an establishment here and you're sure not helping it go smoothly! Thomas, you're in. Save those insults for domming! Thanks!"
	<p>Dane moved vigorously towards the front. Thomas knocked on a few other doors, looking to change rooms, not caring if he took the pay hit, or that they'd all been around the circuit so many times they were part of every room.</div>

						<div class="nanotitle">The Man Who Sought Fortune</div>
						<div class="nanodescription"><p>The Man Who Sought Fortune was inspired by a fairy tale of a similar name that I read in a compilation by Andrew Lang. The tale ended in an old man receiving ill-gotten goods in a chance mishap, and it implied that he lived happily ever after. I decided that this story could not possibly have a happy ending, and that Andrew Lang just wanted to make his readers not worry about the terrible repercussions that might occur should the old man have been found out. This novel became a rough continuation of that story, and, though the way it grapples with age and travel is a little bit clumsy, I think I tried my best, and that it tells a fun story of two crotchety old people on the run trying to fence stolen goods. Unfortunately, this novel does not yet have an ending.</p>

							<p>Summary: Old couple Daal and Marash escape their home in the forest after accidentally acquiring the king's gold. Adventure ensues as they try to fence the goods in nearby cities with the help of Marash's sister. (Alternately) Trying too hard to fantasy about things I don't know enough about</p>

						<p>Influences: Andrew Lang, Lee Brogan, Patricia McKillip.</p></div>
						<div class="nanochapter">	<p>"You just had to," she shrieked, "you just had to open your rotting mouth and complain about your bunions! Your bunions have ruined us! And they aren't even that bad! My feet! Every day! I! Mine! They are the size of an elbow! An elbow!"
	<p>Her bunioned foot stamped against the surface of the table, upsetting a bowl of small forest apples onto the floor. Hands wrung in her graying hair, Daal noted how quickly it had become undone from her cap, flaying wildly about like leaves in the wind. The deep shadows in lantern light amplified every movement.
	<p>"Marash, my dear, maybe this isn't so bad, maybe we can say we found it, and the king will reward-"
	<p>"Have you any sense at all!? You are as stupid as you are lazy! You have less sense than that ass has teeth! The king will kill us! Skin us alive! Use our hides as sacks to take our grain!"
	<p>The table teetered as she shifted her weight. Daal raised his hands to catch her but she leapt off before the furthest leg snapped. Marash let out a growl and a plea, removing her hands from her crown and raising them towards some god hidden in the roof thatch.
	<p>"Woe unto us, fortune, why have you treated us so? Why am I cursed with not one, but two a stupid asses?"
	<p>"Surely there is some way to explain..."
	<p>"Why? There are more heads on his gate than birds on the woods! We were doomed from the moment that ass returned to our stoop, doomed from the moment you lent it to that crook Hestir!"
	<p>"Maybe..."
	<p>"We, we need to leave."
	<p>"What?"
	<p>The conclusiveness of her voice was jarring. He met her and saw the fiery glint in her eyes. Her jaw was set. Her voice turned from harshness to gritty determination. 
	<p>"We need to leave tonight, no, tomorrow before any soldiers are on the roads, while only the common folk are awake. We'll go to... my sister."
	<p>"Eile? In Farriba?"
	<p>"Yes," she said, "yes," she sighed, but her frame tightened after that split moment, and she moved towards a cupboard. 
<p>"Clean up the gold on the floor. Clean up anything you can outside. Who knows how long that ass has been dribbling." He could only see the back, then, the laces of her simple nightgown still loosely tied, "Take your axe. Be back in an hour."
	
<div class="centertext">---</div>	

<p>There once was a woodcutter named Daal. He lived with his wife Marash outside the great kingdom of Parithia. He had lived a long life of toil, working each day to cut wood in order to support his wife. They never had children together, as they could not afford to. There would be too many mouths to feed, and too many years before any of them could swing an axe. Daal worked hard, yet, at the end of each day, he never seemed to become more prosperous.
<p>It was a cold winter morning when he woke up. The late morning sun had risen, and he felt that his entire body had become lead. Every part of him was sore, and there was a heaviness in his heart. His wife came to him, and leaned over their bed.
<p>"The sun is high. Are you not cutting wood today? We've no bread to eat and no money to buy it with."
<p>"No. No! I am not," he declared.
<p>"Are you going to market, then?"
<p>"No. I will not!" he exclaimed.
<p>"Then you will to sit in bed all day while we starve?"
<p>At this, Daal pulled the blankets over his head and turned away from his wife.
<p>"Each day I work until even the smallest bones at the tips of my fingers are sore. My bunions ache, and my legs can barely support me. But what is the use? We barely live!" The lump of blanket on the bed shook with emotion. "I never find fortune. I have decided that today I will wait here, and fortune will have to find me!"
<p>Marash opened her mouth to argue, but she then threw up her hands in exasperation and left her husband in bed. Barely able to believe what she was hearing, she turned her thoughts to what she could possibly forage from the woods.
<p>Daal waited in bed, unable to enjoy the comfort of his sheets, itchy from guilt. Then, he heard a knock on his door. He threw off the covers and opened the door. Outside stood his neighbor, Hestir.
<p>"Daal, you are still in your sleeping clothes," Hestir commented. He had a smile that was all gums and a wiry beard.
<p>Daal was embarrassed. He could not quite put the feeling of shame into words before Hestir spoke.
<p>"May I borrow your ass today?"
<p>Taken aback, Daal again struggled with words.
<p>"No, I need it today to chop wood..."
<p>"Chop wood, or take a nice nap in the woods?" Hestir laughed and shoved him gently on the shoulder. Daal's pride was stung.
<p>"I am about to get ready!"
<p>"It is already noon. By the time you get to the trees, it will be dark. Let me borrow your ass. It won't be long," Hestir said.
<p>Daal saw the logic in his words and agreed, reluctantly, to let Hestir borrow his ass. He unhitched the animal behind the cottage, handed the reigns to Hestir and went back to bed feeling more miserable than ever.
<p>Marash returned later with a basket of scrubby herbs and nuts. 
<p>"Where is the ass?" she asked.
<p>"I let Hestir borrow it for the day," he replied.
<p>Without uttering another word, she put her ingredients in a pot and began to start a fire. Not looking at her husband, she made her soup in silence.
<p>The ass, in fact was being led by Hestir towards an unattended section of the grand palace of Parithia. On the shadowy side of the grounds, just beyond the palace walls, there was carefully dug tunnel covered in a sheet of leaves and twigs. The sun set early, and when it did, Hestir tied the ass to a tree near the tunnel.
<p>"Now, wait here, stupid animal," he commanded. The ass flapped its ear against a fly. 
<p>With a shovel he had brought with him, Hestir descended into the tunnel. When he returned a short while later, he carried with him heaps of gold from the royal palace. Placing all his ill-gotten goods into the ass's packs, he went down the tunnel twice more, until the animal's sides bulged with treasure.
<p>There was a sudden noise from the palace. Torches flared into light, and Hestir's eyes widened. He gave the ass a great shove, urging it forward quickly away from the palace and the murmurs of awakening men. The ass gave a small grunt, and, being a beast accustomed to hauling wood over a long day, began moving slowly away from the palace.
<p>"Move, stupid animal! Move!"
<p>Hestir's pleas became increasingly frantic. More torches were lit around the perimeter of the palace, and he could hear the authoritative calls of army men calling orders. Hestir put all of his weight into pushing the animal. 
<p>The ass slowly trundled through the trees.
<p>The palace gates groaned open. Hestir could hear the sound of men getting closer. In a fit of anger, Hestir took the shovel he was holding and struck the animal a cruel blow with its broad side. The ass gave a shocked squeal and suddenly began running as fast as it could through the woods. In a moment, Hestir would soon be left chasing the sound of a running ass crashing through the forest. As he looked behind himself, he saw a stream of torches break off and move in his direction. He extinguished his lantern and began to run.
<p>As Hestir disappeared into the woods, the ass went the only way it knew. It traveled back to its owner's home, where Daal discovered it laden with treasure. With a whoop of joy, he welcomed it with open arms, relishing his newfound riches living happily ever after in comfort and wealth.
<p>"It's true!" he declared, "I should not have sought fortune, I should have waited for it to come to me!"

<div class="centertext">---</div>

	<p>Daal left his lantern by the front door. He moved through the woods nearby with the grace and wisdom he had gained from a lifetime of cutting. The only sounds were the hooting of owls and the chirps of crickets and the restless pacing of the ass, who was still anxious and lathered from its run. When he was sure there were no royal investigators nearby, pacing around looking for the king's lost gold, he returned for his lamp and passed it over the forest floor. He found a brooch inlaid with clear gems that sparkled like fire in the lantern light, hidden in the leaves, and two gold coins. He placed them in his pocket in wonderment, knowing that these small treasures were worth far more than his life.
	<p>When he opened the door to the cottage once more, Marash had found and placed three large cloth sacks in the middle of their kitchen. The apples had been scooped into a sack, the wooden bowl left to the side. The pile of gold and treasure that had formerly been near the door had been greatly diminished. Their cottage looked a little messy, but felt suddenly unwhole. Little things were gone. There was an empty spot on the rack where a pot once hung. A pair of knives was missing from the stone, too. There was no quilted blanket on their bed. He heard the faintest jingling as Marash moved towards him.
	<p>"Here," she said as she shoved a handful of coins at him, "I've sewn rings, earrings, brooches, even a tiny scepter into my shirt and my pants. Put these in your shoes, hide some in the lantern's oil, put some coins in your pockets. Anywhere."
	<p>Her attention was turned to the shelves of spice bottles near the hearth. He busied himself for a moment, finding any spare pockets in his clothes and secreting a ring into his money pouch. When there seemed to be no other place to hide, he turned to Marash. He noticed now that she was dressed in loose clothes for traveling. Her hair was tied in a knot. He touched her arm. She shook him free as if he burned.
	<p>"Everyone will wonder where we've gone," Daal said, softly.
	<p>She stopped. 
<p>"...Yes," Marash replied.
<p>	"The traders, the other woodcutters, your friends, and the king, once someone realizes we left the very same night his treasure disappeared."
	<p>"You fool!" Marash snapped, "I know this! All of this! But what choice do we have?"
	<p>"We could just throw it in the river! We could bury it beneath the roots of a tree-"
	<p>Marash spat and turned to look him full in the face. There was an anger there that Daal had never seen before. "Is this not what you wanted? You wailed for fortune, wished her to crawl into bed with you! Well here she is, in all her miserable glory, and you think to reject her. Typical! Mincer of a man you are!"
<p>	A tightness ran across Daal's forehead. He moved forward as if to strike Marash, but she hurled a small earthen jar at his chest that burst into a cloud of turmeric. Stunned, Daal choked on the powder, barely avoiding retching. When the noise of his own coughing cleared, he saw Marash, standing, arm to the side, paralyzed in the movement of the moment after she threw the jar, quiet sobs quivering the corners of her lips on the iron mask of her face. Seeing her ceased any desire to hurt. He dusted himself off, and picked up some of the coins that had scattered free from their hiding places in his clothes.
	<p>"Is this," he said, holding up a coin in his two fingers, "what you want?"
	<p>"I... I don't know," she said, her voice shaking.
<p>	"Then we should just throw-"
<p>	"No!" 
<p>	It was clear to him that this gold was not worth their lives. He did not say this, because he knew it was not what she wanted to hear.
<p>	"I will never have gold over you," he entreated. He took her hands and held them in his own, "All the gold in the world, it could be. But, I will always choose you, until I die. No gold can change this. I will go now and throw it all--"
<p>	"No..." she said softly, "No, we can't. It's too late for that. The ass came back with treasure and Hestir did not. Knowing the stupid thing, it wandered home after he got caught. And, knowing Hestir, he's squealed like a caught rabbit, blaming us in order to save his own skin. We're stuck on this path now. We need to leave."
<p>	Daal realized that she'd been thinking deeply as she packed. He could not refute her point. She moved towards him, and he accepted her wordlessly.
<p>	"But it was good of you to say that. Thank you," she said, and she sobbed into shoulder.

						<div class="nanotitle">Quiet Uncorrection</div>
						<div class="nanodescription"><p>Quiet Uncorrection is a somewhat clumsy mini-memoir about my time spent on World of Warcraft pretending to be a girl. Unglamorous, yes, but hilarious, definitely. I am often mistaken for a lady on the phone: the consequent use of voicechat to conduct in-game activities allowed people to assume that I was a girl. Finding this compatible with my projected image, I ran with it and ended up being charming and lovely and adored. People bought me things and when I eventually met them and introduced myself to them as a boy. They didn't freak out terribly. Roughly telling a story, relating in-game events to real life, I experience the way social need transcends internet/meat space boundaries and how, largely, your peers are who you want them to be.</p>

							<p>Summary: A mini-memoir reconstruction of World of Warcraft guild adventures with a genderplay twist, parallels seen in undergrad life. (Alternately) Many, many pages of morally ambiguous catfishing.</p>

						<p>Influences: David Sedaris, Robert Hass, Wildfyre.</p></div>
						<div class="nanochapter"> <p>I was sent off to my local university in fall. This was the first time I decided that I would Quit The Game. I had a new laptop; all I had to do was not install WoW on it, and I would be off the hook scot-free. The game was, somewhat, ruining my dinners, and though it was fun, it seemed like one of those things that might be a bit too addictive, because it coupled two of my weaknesses, online friends and particle effects. At college, I was going to make lots of sexyfriends, and the university campus was going to be a great place to be because the people there would be interesting and I would love what I was learning and I would be able to do whatever I wanted.
	<p>Like most predictions made by 18-year olds about anything, none of these things were true, largely because I had no experience in dealing with sexyfriends, or loving learning, and doing whatever I wanted had amounted, in previous years, to staying up past 10 PM to play Final Fantasy X and eating as much spam as I wanted. It didn't help that I was placed in a triple dorm room in the jock dorm complex about a mile from campus. Any hopes of doing anything exciting had to be weighed against the possibility of getting beaten and mugged in the suburban lamplight of south Berkeley on the walk back. Voicing these opinions loudly to Eilie and on Livejournal, I complained, distinctly, about my roommates having unspoken, possibly unintentional flatulence contests. I also complained about semi-open-stall toilets, people peeing on the seats even though there was a distinct labeled standing stall, people playing "Mad World" on loop on speakers that could probably confuse local seismologists patiently calculating when the next Big One was, a hot nurse who lived next door who gave out free condoms if you told him your name, and the day I woke up and found a half-naked Vietnamese boy on the floor who didn't even give me to chance to offer to share my bed with him.
	<p>"It's still early on. Don't be sad, be indifferent!" a helpful classmate told me.
	<p>Indifferent I was, but indifference can only sustain a body so long before it becomes tiresome and boring. Though my roommate had a Wii that he played with his friends, I couldn't muster the social energy to deal with him and all the cheerful religious people he hung out with. 
<p>The solution to everything, I reasoned, was World of Warcraft. About a month after enduring college life, I found my way down to a local cyber café called Eudemonia that had World of Warcraft installed on its computers. My guild, Red Tear, was at that point trying to get into the realm of 20-man raids. Their numbers fairly ballooned, with new recruitment efforts, bringing in faces that I would deal with for years to come. Red Tear also acquired a sister guild, the "Whitefalcons," that they did collective raids with.
<p>During this time, Red Tear also recruited a night elf hunter named Wildfyre who had deserted a big name guild for one reason or another. My first opportunity to indoctrinate him into the Scarlata fan club came in an UBRS run. I asked him, "why did you pick the name wildfyre?" The obvious answer, "Because Wildfire was already taken" was the correct one. "that's not very interesting," Scarlata commented. It was time to kill Drakkisath, and he was the one responsible for kiting. After pulling the boss and being clubbed to death, I took over, hopping away with the giant dragon general following me. "la la la la la this is how you kite you just have to bounce more" I reminded his corpse.
<p>On my first 6 PM visit to Eudamonia, I discovered that my guild was running Zul'Gurub. I was asked to join them and to heal their sorry behinds as they learned how to kill snake boss.
	<p>There were two remarkable things about Eudemonia. The first was that their rates were something like a dollar an hour, which was easy for me to manage since I spent money on approximately nothing since I was on the meal plan and my mother had already bought me all my books. The second was that they had headsets with microphones that anyone could use. This summarily killed my "I don't have a mic sry" excuse I'd been throwing around for the past 7 months, as I discovered that the default setting on teamspeak was to activate upon sensing the lightest breathing. Someone noticed this, and over voice chat, I heard,
<p>	"Hey, Scar, thanks for joining us on TS."
<p>	Knowing this was my cue, I replied,	"Uh, no problem."
<p>	There was a moment of silence, then Hereticc spoke up.
<p>	"Oh my God, Scar's a girl!1!!!!1"
<p>	At that point, I didn't have to say anything, as everyone else in the guild made noises of mild surprise and comments like "Wow, she's not a dude!" and the marginally more obvious "Wow, she can speak!" with what I was sure were the best of intentions. 
<p>	I stifled my laughter, deciding that I'd never felt more reassured about something that was completely false in my entire life. I noted it would probably be both humorous, and in my best interests to not correct them. I saw little merit in labeling myself as the weird kid who sounds like a girl, or worse to be in a position where people could call me a raging faggot and send me lumps of coal in my in-game mail after kicking me from the guild or demoting me to some sort of untouchable status. I also decided that I'd keep it up for the lulz.
	<p> Taking a step back, it should be noted that I'd been mistaken, multiple times for a woman by various people, like movie ticket sellers, people at the farmer's market, and all manner of telemarkets. It probably has something to do with low sexual dimorphism in Asian-looking faces, and weird issues I had with puberty (mainly the not wanting it at all) that probably affected some sort of psychobiological process. Though it was mildly disappointing to be misgendered, I found it more hilarious in a way that wasn't critical and that any gender women's studies people would probably yell at me for, for being patriarchal and misogynistic or something. Thus far, the worst that had happened was that they gave me a second look and apologized profusely while I got to revel in how uncomfortable they felt, but I'd seen TV specials where worse things happened, and, being somewhat familiar with the internet as the hate machine it truly is, I knew that anyone that was seen as strange or different could easily be ridiculed into submission or cyberbullied into cutting himself or something else dreadful. Whenever my mother happened to be present, she would angrily declare, "That's my son!" and I'd walk away chuckling a little less than I had been before. It wasn't that I didn't appreciate her efforts, I just was sad that it bothered her.
	<p>In any case, I learned to mute my microphone prior to logging into a server so I would never have to speak again. More intrigued than ever, Scarlata speaking on teamspeak became a thing of legend:
	<p>"I think there's one time I heard her voice," Gersho reported, "I was so surprised I accidentally rode off a cliff."
	<p>"I've heard her voice, too," Freyana confirmed, "Long, long ago back before she plugged her microphone into her firewire port or something, earning her the first 'half ban' from the teamspeak server."
	<p>"I heard when Scar talks bunnies smile and the horde fall over and die," said Silver, half hoping this would occur again for an easy battleground win.
	<p>"She speaks to us. She commands us to do her biding. In the deep, dark hour of the night, when the time in between heartbeats is infinite and immeasurable, you can hear her whispering to you. Or maybe that's my wife telling me to stop snoring. Either way," said Wildfyre.  
<p>After that little blip, the rest of the raid went fairly well, and though bat boss constantly killed us because we didn't understand the "group and aoe" bit, I decided that this was way better than moping around in my dorm triple.
	<p>Over the next few days, as I was cheerfully complaining about the cost of "fast riding," I was offered a "free male mount" from one of my guild mates. Appreciating the attention, I considered whether or not I found the thought hot. I decided that, normally, I would have, but that I probably wouldn't want to ride any of these people. After I replied with a "lol gross," day laborer Aloralas mirrored my comment, and I decided that I'd done the right thing. Upon reflection, I was noted that this was my first encounter with what most would consider "flirting," ever, and that it was funny. My soft dismissal seemed to be appropriate, while still maintaining the image of being fun. 
	<p> When I thought about it, I learned that it was the little things that made the difference. Saying "byeeeee" instead of "bye all" was more natural for me. Being excited about everything, as a young person well-versed in internet communication, was just good manners. As an internet junkie, you learn that little IRL victories are causes for celebration. Managed to buy groceries today without a crushing sense of everyone staring at you? Awesome! Went to the doctor's and everything was fine? Great! It was little coincidence, however, that few people understood this and shared my enthusiasm. When our new warlock, Keylala, informed the guild that "woot... my sons not on the bottle anymore!!!!" it was Maveness, Silver's wife, and I who said "congrats Key!" 
<p>"hes not very happy about it but hes dealing with it" she continued. 
<p>"yeah most demon spawn babbies cry over everything, at least he's not throwing fireballs at you" I said, inserting a bit of personal flavor that showed I extra cared; everyone seemed to "lol" in appreciation while I was also able to communicate my personal distaste for babies. I enjoyed being Scarlata. I was good at being Scarlata.
<p>The rest of the year went swimmingly. We cleared ZG, learning the lesson that it was important to infect your raid-mates with whatever horrible dream-sickness you might get from a flying snake god. We also cleared up to General Rajaxx in AQ20. He then repeatedly stomped us, despite our collaborations with various other guilds.	Concurrently, I made my first and only whiny post on the UCBerkeley livejournal community entitled "Making friends, and all that," which could be summarized by the sentence "I go home every weekend and I can't fucking make any friends." Garnering more sympathy than I wanted, (having explicitly stated that I didn't really want to be a charity case), I specifically went out and did what I told myself I wouldn't do, and I went on sympathy lunches with misfits from livejournal. The fruits of my angst became Thai food with a very nice lady named Athena, who was funny and charming, and a sandwich with Asya, an experience that ended in neither of us having the desire to even become facebook friends.

	<p>Harold Aspen had been in school for as long as he could remember. At the ripe old age of 27, he'd already gone through multiple phases of crises, depression and mania: there were phases of feeling like he had no business getting another degree, feeling terrified of the real world, and feeling like he was only there for the women. At this point his current goal seemed to be to amass as much student debt as possible while avoiding paying it. If he stayed in school, he reasoned, he wouldn't have to answer too many questions. The system took in, the system shaped, and it extruded him out in a timely manner. If he'd learned nothing up until this point, it was that it was all the same. 
<p>He crossed his legs in a miscellaneous lecture hall and tucked his toe into the chair in front of him. This was a generous lecture hall, there was enough space for a backpack between rows. All the same, he didn't quite fit into the seats. He'd found a way around this by now. His face was resting in his palm; he had assumed the "dazed" position. The 3-day stubble of his beard had already scratched a rash or two into his hand, but it seemed too much trouble to actively attend rather than just add another. Something, something, Roman architecture, frieze, pantheon, Jupiter, blah, blah, blah. The slides ticked by and professor Burton sounded increasingly bored and tired of everyone's inability to participate. The exam wasn't until December. Harold trusted that he'd somehow remember most of what he needed to say by the time that happened. It wasn't as if he hadn't heard it all before. 
<p>What captured his attention more thoroughly was the fly buzzing around the lecture hall. The fly wasn't enormous, really, it was large but its movements weren't particularly audible. That was the biggest fly he'd seen here. He wondered what it ate. Did it vacuum the surface of the doodoo on the street? They were underground. The only real entrance would have been down the indoor stairwell. Maybe it would die soon without its street doodoo. Was there a trashcan nearby somewhere? 
<p>He spent the rest of the lecture wondering about what the fly could have been eating. When the hour was over he gathered his pencil and his single sheet of paper and walked towards a nearby candy shop (convenient that they should have one on-campus) to meet his latest pull, Candice.
<p>"By my troth, the brilliance of thine countenance shines greater radiance with each passing day."
<p>Candice punched him in the arm and licked her teeth as she smiled. He pecked her on the cheek. She had blonde hair that she pushed out of the way. She'd told him that she liked to put into side braids when she was younger. Now it lay down elegantly flat.
<p>"Hey, love."
<p>"Harry, come on, I want some warheads."
<p>"Can it wait a moment? I want to browse the other sweets before I commit."
<p>Harold took a moment to appraise each of the plastic containers before grabbing a bag and filling it with a scoop of watermelon gummies crusted in sugar. Candice grabbed a handful of warheads and placed them on the scale. 
<p>"I can pay for that," Harold commented as the unimpressed cashier weighed both their selections.
<p>"Oh, Harold, you shouldn't-"
<p>"3.25!" he gasped, "Oh it's in American dollars, sorry, I've been here for months and sometimes I still do that."
<p>He pulled out four bills, looking them over briefly, and handed them over.
<p>Harold had grown up upstate, very far away from anything that could possibly be considered foreign, except for maybe Canada, but nobody counted that. He was the standard sort of mutt European so common in America. There was nothing gracefully, aristocratically British about him. It was simply his latest project to convince Candice that he had come from England to "attend uni in the states" in order to impress her. Inevitably, this illusion would collapse once she came into contact with any of his friends; he realized this clearly, but for some reason that didn't seem to matter. For now, the game was going well. Everyone enjoyed themselves and it was mildly thrilling to almost always be caught in a lie. One thing that helped him was that his name sounded important (what's more British than Harold?) and that he'd watched a lot of Masterpiece Theatre.
<p>Candice and Harold exited the store and went to a nearby bench. As this was art school, the bench was cleverly designed and gifted by prospective students who were ever more aggressive in fighting their way in. The bench they sat on looked like an open tube of lipstick. Candice talked. Harold chewed his gummies as he listened.
<p>"Well, thanks for picking that up. I appreciate it," she told him. The words were kind but Harold could tell she was fighting back minor annoyance. She shook her head and let it go.
<p>"So, anyway, I wanted to ask you something. The playwrights are having a thing and I don't know if I want to go since I'm only kind of close with one of them and I don't really feel cool enough, you know, because they're the sort of people that judge you like you're crap no matter what you wear or what you do if they don't like you already and they don't really like a lot of people. Do you know those sorts of people? They're all over the city and it's just... I don't know, they're kind of fake. Or, I mean, they seem like the fake kind of people, you know?"
<p>"In England, we just call them wankers."
<p>She grinned.
<p>"They're not wankers, but, I mean, well, the thing is that the dancers might be there too, and they're actually pretty cool, at least Aidan and Jel are,"
<p>Harold was silent because he knew she had yet to finish her thought.
<p>"But if they're there also, the apartment might get a little crowded, and I'll probably end up in a corner playing with a cat again."
<p>"Well, if you can't be bothered then don't."
<p>She looked to him and held on to his words in a way that made him feel the vaguest sense of discomfort.
<p>"Thanks for the advice. I think I knew that already but I just wanted you to listen. So, do you want to hang out tonight, then?"
<p>His slightly sugary fingers spidered their way over to hers.
<p>"My place?"
<p>"Do you want me over?"
<p>"Yeah, come over at 9 and we'll have a nice little tea," He waggled his eyebrows enticingly, "though it'll be long past teatime."
<p>"Wipe you hands like a 'propah' person. I'll be there at 9:30."
<p>She handed him a tissue from her bag and began talking about midterms. He tried to remember if he was the type of English person that said "fanks" instead of "thanks." 
<p>By the time she had left for her next class, Harold began thinking. He realized that she was surprisingly straightforward and fairly not intolerable to listen to. He liked that she talked about herself, instead of both of them as a unit. He thought that incredibly mature of her. She was, what, not yet able to go into bars legally, so, 20ish. It would be a shame if, well, it would be a shame if a lot of things happened but he hoped that she wouldn't be upset enough to break up with him when she found out he wasn't British.
<p>Later that day, Harold returned home to his graceless, but functional apartment. He sat on his couch that had probably been chewed on by every stray in the city. It, his "vintage" (beaten) coffee table, and a bed shaped like a child's coffin were the only pieces of furniture where he stayed. Both managed to cause him constant back pain if he slept on them. These were problems that would probably haunt him later. 
<p>It was well before 9, which meant he had time to grab something to eat. He took a moment to think about whether or not he felt like keeping his pants on before deciding to order Thai food from that place nearby that was crappy but that had free soup. He was at the tail end of phoning in his order when there was a hard knock on his door.
<p>"It's Terra." The muffled voice was louder than necessary.
<p>Harold opened the door to find Terra at the most imperfect he'd ever seen. Her hair was loose, and slightly tangled, and her eye make-up and lipstick were mostly missing.  
<p>"Terra, you uh, hey."
<p>Terra stood shifting from foot to foot in front of Harold while he thought about whether or not this was one of those occasions where he should invite her in.
<p>"Sorry, shit went down, I just, I just dumped something on Erin's lap and I can't at her place right now and, okay so I got, we got held up and do you have a vodka?"
<p>"Uh, sure, come in, do you need anything to go-"
<p>"Vodka soda if you have it,"
<p>He didn't, so he just gave her a shot and a glass of water while she went and sat on his couch.
<p>"It's been a while," he said tentatively as he tried to remember what Terra had just told him. The look on her face suggested that he should probably have been more sympathetic but he didn't even know where to begin, "what happened?"
<p>"God, sorry, I'm a mess."
<p>"It's okay, tell me what happened?"
<p>Terra let out a long sigh and put a hand on her forehead. Harold sat next to her. She took a long gulp of her water and let her throat work the story up.
<p>"So Erin and I were in this morning and we got held up and afterwards I was just, I left."
<p>"Oh jesus you got held up? You got held up."
<p>"Yes, it sucked, and then I basically quit on the spot because I can't, it was just the last thing on the stupid camel's hump that made it go fall down a hill or whatever."
<p>The incoherent proverb caught Harold off-guard. In all of their time being together Terra had never jumbled her words. She'd also never let her make-up get completely wiped off, or smear in an unsexy way, even after they'd been through the party-there and party-here scene.
<p>"I want to leave this damn city and I can't."
<p>A pang of some unknown feeling hit him with a soft thud. It resolved into a sort of irrational dread that he tried quickly to mask.
<p>"You want to leave?"
<p>"It's too much for me. I thought this was what I wanted, and I was trying so hard, but it's not working for me. None of this is working for me. I've been here a year and you and Erin and Jim are the only real friends I have and I don't want to be here anymore. And maybe even you aren't my friend, I don't know."
<p>He raised his arm, moved it close to her body, but stopped.
<p>"Hey, hey now, I wouldn't be giving you free vodka if you weren't my friend, would I?"
<p>He didn't touch her but he leaned over to catch her eye.
<p>"Come on, now, it's not so bad," he reassured her.
<p>"How would you know?" she bit back.
<p>"Because if you just follow the yellow brick road or keep walking west then all your problems will go away~" this comment met with a withering look. "No, but, uh, because you're here now, you don't have to think about what happened this morning and nothing is ever as bad as it seems. You can think about it tomorrow."
<p>As flimsy as that sounded Harold, Terra seemed to accept it. She leaned into him. He let his arm rest on her shoulder.
<p>"...yeah, I guess, I don't know, thank you. I'd spent all day on the train and in my apartment crying and I didn't know what to do. Nobody batted a lash because what's another anonymous crazy."
<p>"Well I'm sure none of the crazies are as pretty as you."
<p>Terra sat up and Harold let his arm fall. She managed a smile.
<p>"Thanks. The state I'm in, now, I bet I'd blend right in with the battiest of cat ladies."
<p>"Look, tell you what, do you want to stay here tonight?" He straightened and gestured towards the entire couch. "I know you have roommates but if you didn't want to like, be alone," he mumbled because he wished she'd pretend she hadn't heard that last part.
<p>"Thank you, yes."
<p>"Okay, I just need to make a call. I'll be right back."
<p>Harold moved out to the hall and chewed on his lip wondering what in the world he was doing. Part of him realized that this was the logical decision but a smarter part of him realized that he'd put himself in not one, but two stupid positions. Before he could think his way through the situation, Candice had already launched an inquisitive "Hello?"
<p>"Darling I know this is a right shit thing for me to do, but I can't have you over tonight."
<p>"What? Why?"
<p>"I just remembered I have an exam to revise for and it's massive. Like, half my mark, and if I muck it up my, arse'll be lopped off and shipped right across back the pond because that was one of the bits of fine print on my scholarship."
<p>"Humph. Chopped asses? Really?" She giggled a little and he was relieved that she wasn't irritated enough to not laugh.
<p>"Yea, from spine to bollocks, both cheeks and I'll never be able to sit again. I'm so sorry. Can I make it up to you on the weekend? Tomorrow? Tea for two at actual teatime? I'll buy the scones my own two hands."
<p>"Okay. Fine. You're lucky that you've tapped into my one weakness."
<p>"Have I, then? Scones?"
<p>"A boy that grovels."
<p>She hung up. He pictured her feeling smug while feeling some sort of bad.</div>
