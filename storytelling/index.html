							Escape from Head Royce is an RPG concept written and designed by me and my sister. In brief: "An evil mormon plot is hatched to take over a private school in the Oakland hills. Without warning, teachers shed their kind exteriors and transform the Head Royce School into a dungeon of physical and psychological horror. Will our protagonists, the violent Norma Bates, and the rotund Greasy Cheeks, be able to stop them, and ride away into the sunset on an orange crate tied to a skateboard?" We're hoping it'll be picked up by a AAA game design company and turned into a series with many sequels and spinoffs, and maybe a major motion picture we can star in.

							I've designed and drawn and mapped a few short Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. On this website, I've broken them down into modular story structures with maps, NPCs and encounter descriptions that anyone familiar with the genre can  use to create their own gaming experiences. Based loosely on the Planescape setting, each story draws upon canon and non-canon material to try and engage players with interesting puzzles, and encounters, and my own flavor of humor.

							I've participated in NaNoWriMo <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">(National Novel Writing Month)</a> since 2004. I've generated in that time many, many novels of varying quality, some finished, some stashed in some sort of hole of despair whence they will never see the light of day. A labor of love, and desperation, I've been cranky on many a turkey-day to try and realize a pocket dream of having grand narrative ideas. Following are short excerpts and summaries of my projects.

							Back in the day, I wrote, directed, produced and edited short films of questionable quality, some with my friends, some with me and multiple jars of jam. Don't judge.
